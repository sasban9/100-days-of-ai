Great — let’s zoom in on **Day 18**. By this point, you’ve already built one automation and recorded a Loom demo (Day 17). On **Day 18**, the goal is to create and demonstrate a **second automation** — preferably one that’s more advanced or more business-oriented, so you can show variety in your portfolio.

# 🔎 Day 18: Build & Record Your Second Automation

### 🎯 Objective

Design a **second automation** that solves a real-world workflow problem, record it with Loom, and add it to your growing AI project portfolio.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Choose Your Automation Use Case

Pick something that feels practical for business or productivity. Some solid options:

* **Content Repurposing:** Take a blog post → AI summary → auto-generate 3 LinkedIn posts + send to Buffer for scheduling.
* **Lead Management:** Capture a new Typeform/Google Form entry → enrich data with AI (e.g., auto-generate a personalized follow-up email) → add to CRM (Airtable/HubSpot).
* **Meeting Insights:** Import a Zoom/Meet transcript → AI generates action items → email to participants.
* **Customer Support:** When someone fills a support form → AI drafts a suggested reply → send to help desk (Zendesk/Freshdesk).

Pick **one** depending on whether you want to impress businesses, creators, or personal productivity audiences.

### ✅ Step 2: Map Out the Workflow

Draw the flow on paper (or in a tool like Excalidraw/Miro) before building. Example:

1. Trigger → A new blog post in Google Docs
2. Action → Send content to OpenAI (via Zapier/Make)
3. AI Task → Summarize into short social posts
4. Action → Auto-post to LinkedIn/Twitter

This clarity makes building easier and improves your Loom demo.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Build in Zapier or Make

* If **Zapier:** Create a Zap with 3–4 steps including an AI action.
* If **Make:** Drag-and-drop modules for trigger, AI transformation, and output.
* Test with real data (not just sample data) so your demo looks authentic.

### ✅ Step 4: Record Loom Demo

Structure your video like this (2–4 minutes max):

1. **Intro (20s):** “Today I’ll show you how I automated \[workflow].”
2. **Problem (30s):** Briefly explain why this task is boring/time-consuming manually.
3. **Build Walkthrough (1–2 min):** Show your Zap/Make scenario, explain each step.
4. **Result (30s):** Run the workflow live and show the final AI output.
5. **Outro (10s):** “This automation saves \[time/effort], and I’ll be adding it to my AI portfolio.”

Keep it conversational and clear — think of it like explaining to a friend who doesn’t know AI.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Save & Organize

* Upload Loom demo.
* Save workflow screenshot + description in your Notion/portfolio.
* Write a **2–3 sentence summary**:

  * Problem → “Manual repurposing of content wastes hours.”
  * Solution → “Automation repurposes blogs into LinkedIn posts instantly.”
  * Benefit → “Saves \~3 hours per week for content creators.”

### 🎁 Stretch Goal (Optional)

Post the Loom demo on LinkedIn/Twitter with a short caption like:
“Built my 2nd AI automation: turns blog posts into LinkedIn-ready content in seconds. No code. No stress. 🚀 #100DaysOfAI”
