Got it — let’s zoom in on **Day 20: Share a post: “3 ways I automated boring tasks with AI this week.”**

This day is not just about hitting publish. It’s a key milestone in your roadmap because it forces you to reflect, document, and showcase your progress. Here’s how you can expand Day 20 into a **mini action plan**:

---

### **Morning: Reflection & Content Gathering**

1. Open your automation logs in Zapier/Make and list the 3 workflows you’ve built so far (examples: email summaries, auto social posting, meeting note summarizer).
2. For each workflow, write down:

   * **The Problem** (What was boring or repetitive?)
   * **The Solution** (How AI + automation fixed it)
   * **The Impact** (How much time/effort it saved you).
3. Collect screenshots or short Loom screen recordings of each automation in action.

### **Afternoon: Write the Draft Post**

Structure your post in 3 parts:

* **Hook (1–2 lines):** “Last week, I was drowning in repetitive tasks. Instead of suffering, I automated them with AI — and it feels like having a personal assistant on call.”
* **Body (the 3 automations):** Share them in simple language. Keep each description short, like:

  1. *Email overload?* I set up an AI to auto-summarize every incoming email into 3 bullet points.
  2. *Social media posting?* I made a Zap that takes my Google Doc ideas and publishes them straight to LinkedIn.
  3. *Meeting notes?* My Zoom transcripts now get auto-summarized into action items in Notion.
* **Call-to-Action:** “If you want me to share how I built these, drop a comment 👇”

### **Evening: Publish & Engage**

1. Post it on **LinkedIn** (ideal for professional visibility) or **Twitter/X** (for reach among AI builders).
2. Add visuals: screenshots of automation dashboards, or a short GIF of your bot running.
3. Engage after posting: reply to first 5 comments quickly to push reach.
4. Save the post in your **Portfolio/Case Studies folder** as evidence of your growing AI skillset.

### **Bonus (Optional)**

* Repurpose the content: turn the same post into a **short reel/video** (“Here are 3 boring tasks I automated with AI this week — watch this!”).
* Add it to your **Day 20 milestone blog/portfolio entry**: “Automating my first workflows with AI.”

👉 The goal of Day 20 is not just sharing — it’s about **positioning yourself publicly as an AI practitioner**. By the end of today, you’ll have your first mini case study visible to the world.
