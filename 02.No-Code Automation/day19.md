Alright, let’s zoom in on **Day 19: Add both demos to your portfolio site** and expand it into a step-by-step playbook so you don’t just “upload something,” but actually create a professional showcase that will impress future clients, employers, or investors.

## 🌟 **Day 19 Expanded — Portfolio Integration of AI Automations**

### 1. Choose Your Platform

Pick a no-code site builder where you’ll keep adding all your AI projects across the 100 days.

* **Carrd** → easiest, one-page style.
* **Notion** → clean, editable, easy to share.
* **Webflow** → best if you want a polished, professional look.
  If you’re still undecided, go with **Notion for now**. It’s fast, flexible, and you can always migrate later.

---

### 2. Structure Your Portfolio

Create sections to make your work easy to navigate. Suggested layout:

* **Intro/About Me**: short bio + what you do with AI.
* **Projects**: each project gets its own card/page.
* **Automations** (today’s focus).
* Later you’ll add Apps, Chatbots, Dashboards, etc.

---

### 3. Polish Your Demo Content

You already recorded two Loom videos of your automations (Days 17 and 18). Now:

* Re-record if they’re messy or too long (keep each under 3 minutes).
* Add captions or callouts to make the video easy to follow.
* Upload them to Loom, Vimeo, or YouTube (unlisted if you don’t want them public yet).

---

### 4. Write a Case Study for Each Demo

Don’t just show the video—frame it like a mini-story. Each project entry should have:

* **Title**: “Email Summarizer with AI”
* **Problem**: “Managing emails was overwhelming for busy professionals.”
* **Solution**: “I built an automation that reads Gmail, summarizes emails using AI, and logs them in Google Sheets.”
* **Tools Used**: Gmail + Zapier + OpenAI + Google Sheets.
* **Result**: “Cuts 1 hour/day of manual sorting. Scales easily.”
* **Demo Video**: embedded Loom link.

---

### 5. Design for Professional Impact

* Use clean visuals—icons for tools (Zapier, Google, OpenAI).
* Add screenshots of the workflow interface so non-technical people understand.
* Use 2–3 consistent brand colors so your portfolio feels cohesive.

---

### 6. Add Calls to Action

At the bottom of each project page, add:
👉 “Want me to build something similar for your team? Let’s talk.”
Link it to your **email** or **Calendly**.

---

### 7. Publish & Share

Once the demos are up:

* Share the link with a friend/mentor for quick feedback.
* Make a soft announcement post: “Just added my first 2 AI automation demos to my portfolio—excited to build more over the next 100 days.”

---

✅ By the end of Day 19, you won’t just “have 2 demos online.” You’ll have the **foundation of a living AI portfolio** that grows every week—clients and collaborators can track your journey in real time.
