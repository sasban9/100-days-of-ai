## 🔍 **Day 17 Expansion — Your First AI Automation Demo**

**Goal:** Turn one of your AI automations into a short, polished video demo you can use for your portfolio, social media, and client pitches.

---

### 1. **Pick Your Automation**

Choose the simplest automation you’ve already built (from Days 11–16). Examples:

* Gmail → AI summary → Google Sheets log.
* Google Doc → AI → auto-post to LinkedIn.
* Meeting transcript → AI summary → Slack/Email.

👉 Pick the one that’s **most relatable** (so a future client thinks, “Oh, I need this too!”).

---

### 2. **Plan Your Storyboard**

Before recording, outline what you’ll show:

1. **Problem:** “Manually summarizing emails takes forever.”
2. **Solution:** “I set up a Zapier + ChatGPT automation.”
3. **Demo:** Show the automation running in real-time.
4. **Result:** End with the neat AI output (summary in Sheet/Slack).

Keep it under **2–3 minutes**.

---

### 3. **Record the Loom**

* Open Loom (or use any screen recorder).
* Turn on camera bubble (people connect better when they see your face).
* Narrate while showing your screen. Speak clearly:

  * What the problem is.
  * How the automation works step by step.
  * The “aha moment” when AI delivers the result automatically.

---

### 4. **Polish & Share**

* Title the video: *“How I Automated \[Task] with AI in 5 Minutes”*.
* Save to Loom.
* Add a short description. Example: *“This Zapier + ChatGPT automation takes customer emails and generates instant summaries into a Google Sheet. No manual work needed.”*

---

### 5. **Repurpose the Demo**

* **Portfolio:** Embed the Loom in your website/Notion.
* **Social Media:** Share a 30–60s clip on LinkedIn/Twitter with the caption:
  *“Manually summarizing emails takes 2–3 hours a week. I built this no-code AI automation in 30 mins — here’s how it works 👇”*.
* **Client Pitches:** Send it to prospects: *“Here’s a sample of how I use AI to save time. Could do something similar for your business.”*

✅ By the end of Day 17, you’ll not just have an automation running, but **a visible proof of your skill** — something you can show off, re-use, and monetize.
