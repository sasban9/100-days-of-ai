## 🔹 **Day 16: Build an RSS → AI Summary → Slack Workflow in Make.com**

### 🎯 Goal

Whenever a new blog/news article is published (via RSS feed), your automation will:

1. Grab the article.
2. Send it to an AI model for summarization.
3. Post the summary automatically to your Slack (or even email, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.).

This is the foundation of building **AI-powered research assistants**.

### 🛠 Tools Needed

* **Make.com** (free account works)
* **RSS Feed URL** (e.g., TechCrunch, Hacker News, or a blog you follow)
* **OpenAI API key** (or use Make’s built-in ChatGPT module)
* **Slack account** (or any other notification channel)

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Set Up a Scenario in Make**

   * Log in → Create new Scenario.
   * First module: **RSS → Watch RSS Feed Items**.
   * Paste in your RSS feed link (e.g., [https://techcrunch.com/feed/](https://techcrunch.com/feed/)).
   * Set it to check every 15 minutes (or hourly).

2. **Extract Article Data**

   * The RSS module gives you title, link, and content snippet.
   * Pass these forward to the next module.

3. **Send Content to AI for Summarization**

   * Add **OpenAI module**.
   * Choose GPT-4 or GPT-3.5.
   * Prompt idea:

     ```
     Summarize this article in 3 bullet points for a busy professional.
     Article title: {{title}}
     Article link: {{link}}
     Article content: {{content}}
     ```
   * Output: a concise, human-readable summary.

4. **Post to Slack**

   * Add **Slack → Send a Message** module.
   * Format message:

     ```
     📰 New AI Summary:
     *{{title}}*
     {{summary}}
     🔗 {{link}}
     ```

5. **Test It**

   * Trigger the scenario manually.
   * See if Slack message shows up clean.

6. **Turn On Automation**

   * Save & switch the Scenario **ON**.
   * Now you’ll get live AI-curated updates automatically.
