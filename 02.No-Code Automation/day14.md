Great — let’s dive into **Day 14: Build automation → Google Doc → social post → auto-publish on LinkedIn.**

The idea here is to **turn one long piece of writing into multiple micro-posts** automatically. This saves hours if you’re sharing insights, blogs, or updates.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Setup Tools

* **Google Docs** → where you’ll write or paste your long content.
* **Zapier** (or Make.com) → to automate the workflow.
* **OpenAI / ChatGPT API** → to summarize + rewrite content into posts.
* **LinkedIn (Zapier integration)** → to publish posts directly.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Create Workflow in Zapier

1. **Trigger:**

   * New Document in Google Docs (or a specific folder).
   * Example: Every time you drop a new draft into a “Content for AI” folder, Zapier detects it.

2. **Step 1 – Extract Content:**

   * Zapier pulls the text from the Google Doc.

3. **Step 2 – AI Processing:**

   * Send text to OpenAI via Zapier.
   * Prompt Example:

     ```
     Turn the following text into 3 LinkedIn-style posts (each under 200 words). Make them engaging, conversational, and end with a question. Input: [insert Google Doc text]
     ```

4. **Step 3 – Formatting:**

   * Store AI output in Google Sheets (archive of posts).
   * Optional: split into separate rows → one per post.

5. **Step 4 – Auto-Publish:**

   * Zapier → LinkedIn integration.
   * Choose whether to publish immediately, or save as a draft for review.

### 🔹 Step 3: Test With Example

Suppose your Google Doc is a **blog about “AI in Education.”**

AI could turn it into:

* Post 1: “AI tutors aren’t replacing teachers, but making learning personal. Would you let your child use one?”
* Post 2: “90% of students forget half of what they learn in class. AI can help with spaced repetition. Do you think schools are ready?”
* Post 3: “Imagine a classroom where every student gets a custom lesson plan daily. AI makes it possible. Should schools adopt it?”

Zapier then publishes one of these daily.

### 🔹 Step 4: Optional Enhancements

* Add **image generation** (MidJourney / DALL·E → Zapier → attach to post).
* Add **analytics loop**: log post engagement (likes, comments) back to Google Sheets.
* Add **multi-channel posting**: same content repurposed → Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram.

---

### 🔹 What You’ll Achieve by End of Day 14

* A fully automated **Content Repurposing Machine**.
* Drop one article into Google Docs → get multiple social media posts published automatically.
* Saves \~80% of your content marketing time.
