Great — let’s zoom into **Day 11: Sign up for Zapier + Make. Watch beginner tutorials.**

Instead of just "sign up," I’ll give you a full **mini action plan** so you end the day with hands-on confidence.

## 🌱 **Day 11 Expanded: Kickstart No-Code Automation**

### 1. **Set Up Your Tools (1 hour)**

* Go to [Zapier](https://zapier.com) → sign up for a free account.
* Go to [Make](https://make.com) → sign up for a free account.
* Install Zapier Chrome Extension (optional but useful for testing automations).
* Connect your main accounts: Google (Docs, Drive, Gmail, Sheets), Slack, Notion.

👉 End of this step: You now have both platforms ready, with your tools connected.

---

### 2. **Learn the Basics (1.5 hours)**

* Watch Zapier’s **Getting Started** video (10 min) + their first tutorial (15 min).
* Watch Make’s **Beginner Scenario** video (15 min).
* Read Zapier’s “Zaps explained” and Make’s “Scenarios explained.”
* Write down the key difference in your notes: *Zapier = linear workflows, Make = more visual branching workflows.*

👉 End of this step: You understand the mindset of connecting apps → triggers → actions.

---

### 3. **Do Your First Automation (1.5 hours)**

* In **Zapier**: Create a Zap → Trigger: Gmail “new email” → Action: Add to Google Sheet.
* In **Make**: Create a Scenario → Trigger: New row in Google Sheet → Action: Send Slack/Telegram message.

👉 End of this step: You’ve actually built 2 working automations.

---

### 4. **Reflect & Document (30 min)**

* Open Notion/Google Doc → create a page: “My AI Automation Journey.”
* Write down: What you automated, what worked, what didn’t.
* Capture screenshots of your Zaps/Scenarios.
* Note 3 ideas for automations you could use in your personal or work life (example: save all attachments from Gmail → Google Drive).

👉 End of this step: You’re not just following, you’re building your own automation brain.

### 🎯 **End-of-Day Deliverable**

* Zapier account + 1 Zap live
* Make account + 1 Scenario live
* A personal “automation journal” started with screenshots + notes
