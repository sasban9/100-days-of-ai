Absolutely! **Day 36** is part of the **Chatbots & Assistants** stage (Days 31–40) and focuses on creating a **personalized AI assistant** trained on your own content — your portfolio, notes, or any knowledge base you want the bot to “know.” This is a key milestone because it’s your first bot that’s **uniquely yours**, not generic.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Objective of Day 36**

Create a chatbot that understands your personal content so it can answer questions, summarize, or guide users as if it were “you.” This demonstrates **real-world AI customization** without coding.

---

### **Tools You Can Use**

* **Chatbase** (easiest for PDFs, Docs, websites)
* **Voiceflow** (for conversational flows + voice)
* **Tiledesk** (for embedding on a website)
* **Botpress** (if you want a more advanced but still low-code option)

---

### **Step-by-Step Plan**

1. **Select Your Content**

   * Decide what knowledge the bot should have:

     * Your portfolio PDFs or Notion pages
     * Notes from your 100-day AI journey
     * FAQs about your skills or services

2. **Upload to the Platform**

   * In **Chatbase**:

     * Create a new bot
     * Upload PDF, Word doc, or link your website
     * Let the platform index the content

3. **Set the Bot Personality**

   * Give it a role: “You are an AI assistant representing Saswata. Your job is to answer questions about my AI projects, portfolio, and journey.”
   * Define tone: professional, friendly, or creative depending on your brand

4. **Test Queries**

   * Ask questions to make sure the bot understands your content:

     * “What automations did I build in Week 2?”
     * “Summarize my AI brand kit project.”
     * “What are my top 3 skills in no-code AI?”
   * Refine by adding clarifications if the bot misunderstands

5. **Polish & Customize**

   * Set welcome messages, default answers for unknown queries
   * Add interactive features if available (buttons, quick replies)

6. **Publish / Share**

   * Embed the chatbot on your portfolio website
   * Share a link to friends or LinkedIn for feedback

---

### **Deliverables for Day 36**

* A **personal AI assistant** trained on your content
* Screenshots or Loom video demo for your portfolio
* Confidence in building **custom AI bots** for clients in the future

---

**Why Day 36 is Important**

* It’s the first time your AI work becomes **personalized and brandable**.
* You can replicate this for **clients**: any business document, FAQ, or knowledge base can be turned into a bot.
* You now have **tangible proof** of your AI skill that’s unique and sharable.
