### **Day 39: Build & Showcase Your AI Chatbots**

**Objective:** Make your chatbots visible, interactive, and “shareable,” so they can demonstrate real-world utility.

#### **Step 1: Choose the Bot to Showcase**

* Pick your **most polished bot** from the past week:

  * Could be your **AI Fitness Coach** bot.
  * Or a **business FAQ bot** trained on a real PDF/website content.
* Make sure it can respond reliably to a variety of user inputs.

---

#### **Step 2: Prepare a Demo Version**

* If using **Chatbase** or **Botpress**, generate a **public share link** or embed code.
* Ensure all prompts and flows are clear. Avoid broken or “confused” responses.
* Optional: Give the bot a **friendly name and persona** to make it memorable.

---

#### **Step 3: Record a Demo Video**

* Use **Loom or OBS** to record:

  1. Introduction: “This is my AI Fitness Coach chatbot.”
  2. Show interaction: Ask 3–5 questions it can answer well.
  3. Highlight features: context awareness, multi-step reasoning, helpful suggestions.
* Keep it short: 1–2 minutes max.

---

#### **Step 4: Add to Portfolio**

* Upload the video to **Notion, Carrd, or your portfolio website**.
* Include a **live link** if possible, so viewers can test the bot themselves.
* Write a **short case description**:

  * Goal of the bot
  * AI tools used (Chatbase, Voiceflow, GPT-4o, etc.)
  * Challenges you solved

---

#### **Step 5: Share Publicly**

* Optional but recommended: post on **LinkedIn or Twitter** with a small write-up:

  * “Built a no-code AI chatbot in 7 days. Here’s how it helps fitness enthusiasts plan workouts and track goals.”
  * Include a GIF or video snippet for engagement.

---

**Outcome of Day 39:**

* You now have a **showpiece chatbot** that demonstrates your no-code AI skills.
* Portfolio visitors or potential clients can **interact with the bot or watch a demo**, making your work credible and tangible.
* This is also a **social proof asset** — something to reference in sales, pitches, or future projects.
