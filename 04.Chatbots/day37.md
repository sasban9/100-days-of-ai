Absolutely — let’s zoom in on **Day 37: Build a niche AI bot “AI Fitness Coach.”** I’ll break it down step by step so you know exactly what to do, even with no code.

---

### **Objective of Day 37**

Create a chatbot that can act as a personal fitness assistant: giving workout suggestions, diet tips, and motivational support — all powered by AI. This is a **niche-focused portfolio piece** that’s highly demoable and easy to show potential clients.

---

### **Step 1: Define Scope**

Decide exactly what your bot will do. For a fitness coach bot, you could include:

* Generate daily workout routines (bodyweight, gym, or home).
* Suggest nutrition/diet plans based on goals.
* Provide motivational tips.
* Answer basic fitness questions (e.g., “What’s a good warm-up?”).

**Tip:** Keep it simple — don’t try to cover everything. Focus on 2–3 main functions.

---

### **Step 2: Gather Content**

* Create a small dataset for the bot to reference if needed.

  * Example: Sample exercises with descriptions, sets/reps, difficulty levels.
  * Sample nutrition advice (calories, macros, meal examples).
* You can also let the bot generate advice dynamically using GPT or Claude without storing your own dataset.

---

### **Step 3: Choose Platform**

* **Chatbase**: Upload content (PDF, CSV, or plain text) and train the bot.
* **Voiceflow**: Build a more interactive conversational bot (voice or chat).
* **Tiledesk or Botpress**: Alternative if you want a website-embedded bot.

**Day 37 tip:** Use Chatbase for simplicity — it’s fast and requires almost zero coding.

---

### **Step 4: Build the Bot**

* Create a new bot in your chosen platform.
* Add intents (types of user questions):

  * “Suggest a workout” → bot replies with generated routine.
  * “Diet plan for weight loss” → bot replies with sample meals.
  * “Motivate me” → bot replies with motivational quote or advice.
* Use AI to handle natural language input so users don’t have to pick from strict options.

---

### **Step 5: Test**

* Ask the bot multiple types of questions:

  * “I have 30 minutes, what workout should I do?”
  * “I’m a vegetarian, what should I eat for lunch?”
* Refine responses if they’re unclear, repetitive, or off-topic.

---

### **Step 6: Add Personality**

* Give the bot a friendly tone: encouraging, positive, motivating.
* Example: “You got this! Here’s a 20-minute workout that will make you feel energized.”

---

### **Step 7: Demo**

* Record a Loom video showing:

  1. A user typing a question.
  2. The bot responding intelligently.
  3. A short interaction demonstrating its usefulness.
* Optional: Embed the bot on your portfolio site.

---

### **Outcome of Day 37**

By the end of this day, you will have:

* A working **niche AI chatbot**.
* A **demo-ready piece** to showcase in your portfolio.
* Experience in **training a no-code AI bot** and understanding user interactions.
