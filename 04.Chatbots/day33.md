On **Day 33** of your 100 Days of AI challenge, the focus is:

👉 **Embed chatbot on a test website/Notion page**

Here’s what that really means and how to do it:

---

### 1. Pick your chatbot platform

Since Day 31 you started with **Chatbase**, this is the easiest one to continue with. Chatbase automatically gives you an **embed code** for the chatbot you trained on your PDF or website.

* Go to your Chatbase dashboard.
* Open the bot you created.
* Look for **“Embed”** or **“Share”** options.
* You’ll see something like a small **JavaScript snippet** or an **iframe code**.

---

### 2. Embed on a test website

If you don’t have a website yet, you can test with free tools:

* **Notion page** → use the **/embed** block and paste the code.
* **Carrd.co** → super simple no-code landing page builder, paste the code into the “Embed” widget.
* **Google Sites** → free, drag-and-drop, supports embed code.
* **Your own HTML page** → paste the code into the `<body>` section.

When you publish, your chatbot will appear as a floating widget or an embedded chat window.

### 3. Customize it (optional)

* Change the widget color, text, and position.
* Add your **name or brand** (“Hi, I’m your AI assistant”).
* Set a **welcome message** so users know what to ask.

---

### 4. Test it

* Open the page in incognito mode and try talking to your bot as a user.
* Ask 3–5 typical questions and see if it responds well.
* Note down what’s missing → maybe you need to feed it more documents, FAQs, or context.

---

### 5. Document it

* Take a screenshot or record a 1-min Loom video showing your bot working.
* Add it to your portfolio folder.
* Save the link to your test site (you’ll use this later when you show clients).

💡 **Outcome of Day 33:** You now have a **live, working chatbot** that anyone can interact with. This is the first time your AI project is public-facing and usable beyond your laptop.
