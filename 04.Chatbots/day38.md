Absolutely — let’s deep dive into **Day 38: Build a niche bot: “AI Fitness Coach”**. This is a key day because it combines everything you’ve learned so far: prompt engineering, no-code tools, and a real-world application that can later become a paid product or portfolio piece.

### **Goal of Day 38**

Create an **AI-powered chatbot** specialized in a niche (fitness coaching). It should be able to answer questions, give advice, and provide actionable guidance based on user input.

---

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Define Scope (10–15 minutes)**

Decide what your bot can and cannot do. For example:

* **Can do:** Give workout plans, explain exercises, provide nutrition tips, track goals.
* **Cannot do:** Provide medical advice, replace a professional trainer.

Write this as a short “bot description” for clarity. Example:

> “You are a friendly AI Fitness Coach. You create beginner-friendly workout plans, suggest exercises, and give motivational tips. You never give medical advice.”

---

#### **2. Prepare the Prompts (30–45 minutes)**

Craft a few role-specific prompts:

* **Greeting prompt:** “Greet the user and ask about their fitness goals.”
* **Workout prompt:** “Create a 30-minute beginner workout for someone who can train 3 days/week.”
* **Nutrition prompt:** “Suggest a sample high-protein meal plan for a vegetarian.”
* **Motivation prompt:** “Provide an encouraging message if the user says they feel tired or demotivated.”

Test these prompts in ChatGPT first and refine them until outputs are consistent and useful.

---

#### **3. Build the Bot (1–2 hours)**

* Sign in to **Chatbase** (or Voiceflow if you want voice features).
* Create a new bot project called **“AI Fitness Coach.”**
* Upload any reference material: PDF guides, exercise routines, or nutrition charts.
* Add your prepared prompts as different intents or flows in the chatbot builder.
* Set a default answer for unrecognized questions:

> “I’m not a medical professional. For any health concerns, please consult a certified trainer or doctor.”

---

#### **4. Test & Iterate (30–45 minutes)**

* Simulate different users: beginners, advanced, vegetarian, someone looking for weight loss.
* Check if answers are coherent, actionable, and friendly.
* Adjust prompts if needed to make answers shorter, structured, or more motivational.

---

#### **5. Record Demo & Document (30 minutes)**

* Record a Loom video or GIF demo of your bot in action.
* Capture 3–5 different interactions: workout plan, nutrition tip, motivational message.
* Save this as part of your **portfolio** or future marketing content.

---

### **Optional Enhancements**

* Add **multi-turn conversations**: bot remembers previous interactions.
* Embed the bot on a **Notion page** or a **test website**.
* Connect to a **calendar or reminders** for users to schedule workouts.

---

### **Deliverable by End of Day 38**

1. Fully functional **AI Fitness Coach bot**.
2. 3–5 demo interactions recorded.
3. Portfolio-ready screenshots or Loom video.
4. Ready to share publicly as a niche case study.

If you want, I can **design Day 38 as a visual workflow**, showing exactly how prompts, flows, and outputs connect, so you can literally follow it step by step without confusion. It would look like a mini blueprint for building niche bots.

Do you want me to do that?
