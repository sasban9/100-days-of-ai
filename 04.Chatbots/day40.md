Absolutely! Let’s deep dive into **Day 40 — showcasing your chatbots publicly**, which is a crucial milestone in your 100-day AI roadmap. This is where all the work you’ve done in Weeks 3–4 (building chatbots and AI assistants) becomes visible and shareable, so you start building credibility, confidence, and potential leads.

## **Day 40: Share Your AI Chatbots Publicly**

### **Objective**

* Make your chatbots accessible to others.
* Turn your mini-projects into tangible proof of skill.
* Generate excitement and visibility for your AI work.

---

### **Step 1: Choose Your Chatbots**

By Day 40, you should have at least **two chatbots**:

1. **Personal AI assistant** (e.g., Career Coach, Study Planner, Fitness Guide)
2. **Business/industry-oriented bot** (e.g., FAQ bot for a café, real estate listing helper, or e-commerce assistant)

Pick the one(s) you feel are polished enough for a first public demonstration.

### **Step 2: Hosting & Sharing**

* **Chatbase:** Generate a shareable link or embed code. Chatbase allows anyone to interact with your chatbot online without logging in.
* **Voiceflow:** Publish your chatbot and get a web link or mobile-ready prototype.
* **Tiledesk / Botpress:** Export the bot to a small test website or embed on a portfolio page.
* **Optional:** Add a **demo video** using Loom or OBS if embedding isn’t seamless.

---

### **Step 3: Portfolio Integration**

* Add each bot to your **portfolio site or Notion page**:

  * Include **title, purpose, and screenshots**.
  * Embed the live bot or provide the link.
  * Write a 2–3 sentence **explanation** of what it does and how you built it.

Example:

> “AI Career Coach — a chatbot trained to give personalized career advice based on your inputs. Built using Chatbase and OpenAI GPT-4. Try it here: \[link]”

---

### **Step 4: Public Sharing & Feedback**

* Post on **LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or a relevant Discord community**.

* Suggested format:

  1. “After 40 days of building AI projects, I’m excited to share my first chatbots!”
  2. Short description of each bot’s purpose.
  3. Live link or embedded demo.
  4. Ask for feedback: “Try it and tell me what you think — your feedback helps me improve!”

* Encourage interaction: the more people test your bots, the more confidence and credibility you gain.

---

### **Step 5: Optional Stretch Goal**

* Create a **mini-use case video**:

  * Show a user interacting with your bot.
  * Highlight AI responses and workflows.
  * 30–60 seconds is enough. This can later be part of your marketing/portfolio reel.

---

### **Outcome of Day 40**

* Publicly accessible AI chatbot(s) demonstrating real functionality.
* Portfolio updated with live demos.
* Social proof and potential leads for future freelance work or product testing.
* Confidence boost — you’re now creating *visible AI products*, not just experimenting privately.
