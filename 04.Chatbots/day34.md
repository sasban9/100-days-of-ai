Day 34 is where you step up from “toy chatbots” to something closer to what companies actually use. The tool for this is **Voiceflow**, which was originally built for Alexa/Google voice assistants but has since evolved into one of the best no-code platforms for designing and deploying **AI-powered conversational agents**.

Here’s how to approach it on Day 34:

---

### 🎯 Goal of Day 34

Build your first **AI customer support bot** in Voiceflow that can answer basic questions, handle small talk, and redirect to a human when it’s stuck.

---

### 🛠 What to Do

1. **Sign up for Voiceflow** (free tier is enough to begin).
2. **Start a new Assistant project.** You’ll see a flowchart-style canvas — drag-and-drop blocks are how you design the conversation.
3. **Create a greeting flow.** Use a “Speak” or “Text” block with something like:
   *“Hi! I’m your AI support assistant. How can I help you today?”*
4. **Add AI response handling.** Use the “AI Response” block to connect to GPT (via their built-in integration) so the bot can handle open-ended questions.
5. **Train with FAQs.** Upload a small dataset (maybe 10–20 FAQs from a sample company, or even from your own site idea). This grounds the bot in specific knowledge rather than just being generic.
6. **Add a “Fallback to Human” path.** If the AI doesn’t know, it should say:
   *“I’m not sure about that, but I can connect you with a team member.”*
   → Then simulate handing off.
7. **Test in preview mode.** Talk to the bot as if you were a confused customer. Ask things like:

   * “What are your business hours?”
   * “Do you have a refund policy?”
   * “Can I speak to a human?”
8. **Tweak tone and style.** Make the bot friendly, concise, and branded.

### 📚 Extra Learning

* **Templates:** Voiceflow has ready-made templates for customer service — clone one and study it.
* **Analytics:** Even on free tier, you can see conversation logs, which teaches you how to improve the bot.
* **Channels:** Once it works, you can integrate with Messenger, WhatsApp, or your website.

---

### 💡 Deliverable for Day 34

By the end of the day you should have a working prototype of a **customer support assistant** that:

* Greets users,
* Answers FAQs with grounded knowledge,
* Uses AI for flexible responses,
* Has a fallback option for human handoff.

This is a perfect **portfolio piece** because every business understands customer support, and showing you can stand up a working bot in a single day proves practical value.

Do you want me to also sketch **what your customer support bot could look like for a specific industry** (say, e-commerce, education, or real estate), so you build something niche instead of a generic demo?
