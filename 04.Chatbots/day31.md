Great choice — Day 31 is the start of the **Chatbot phase**. Let’s expand it so you know exactly what to do, step by step, without confusion.

# 🔹 **Day 31: Build Your First AI Chatbot (with Chatbase)**

**Goal:** By the end of today, you’ll have a working chatbot trained on your own knowledge base (like a PDF or website).

---

### **Step 1: Sign up & Explore**

* Go to **[chatbase.co](https://www.chatbase.co/)**.
* Create a free account.
* Explore the dashboard — you’ll see options like “Create New Chatbot.”

---

### **Step 2: Upload Knowledge Source**

* Choose **“Upload File”** (PDF, DOCX, or TXT). For practice, upload something you know well:

  * Your CV/Resume (so the bot answers career questions about you).
  * A company brochure or course notes.
  * A public PDF like a startup handbook.
* Wait for Chatbase to process and train the bot.

---

### **Step 3: Test the Bot**

* Ask questions about the uploaded file:

  * “Summarize this document in 5 points.”
  * “What is the main idea in section 2?”
  * “Can you explain this to a 12-year-old?”
* Check if the answers are accurate.

---

### **Step 4: Customize Personality**

* In **Settings**, you’ll see options to adjust tone. Examples:

  * Professional consultant.
  * Friendly teacher.
  * Witty assistant.
* Pick one style and test again.

---

### **Step 5: Embed & Share**

* Copy the **embed code** (iframe or script).
* Paste it in a simple website (Notion page, Carrd, or even a basic HTML page).
* Now your chatbot is “live” and shareable.

---

### **Step 6: Reflect & Document**

* Write down:

  * What document you trained it on.
  * How accurate it was.
  * Any cool use cases you see (customer support, personal knowledge base, FAQ assistant).
* Add screenshots to your **AI Project Portfolio** folder.

---

✅ **End of Day Outcome:**

* A trained AI chatbot based on your chosen document.
* You can interact with it, share a public link, and embed it in a site.
