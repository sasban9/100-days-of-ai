Perfect — let’s expand **Day 60**. This is a pivotal day because it’s the **culmination of your first multi-agent workflow sprint**. By the end of Day 60, you should have a working system that chains multiple AI “agents” together, ready to showcase as a demo or portfolio project.

## **Day 60 — Lesson Expansion: Multi-Agent Workflow Demo**

### **Goal**

By the end of the day, you will have a **fully working multi-agent AI workflow** that can autonomously handle a complex task, from input to final output, without manual intervention. You’ll also record a **demo video** to showcase your work.

---

### **Step 1: Review Your Workflow**

* Ensure your workflow has at least **3 agents**:

  1. **Research Agent:** Gathers or generates information.
  2. **Summarizer Agent:** Condenses the information into usable content.
  3. **Content Writer Agent:** Formats output (blog post, social media, email, table, etc.).

* Optional 4th Agent: **Output Formatter/Publisher** that converts the final output into the desired format or posts it automatically.

* Checklist:

  * Input source is defined (text prompt, PDF, URL, database).
  * Each agent is assigned a clear task.
  * Connections between agents are working (output → input).

---

### **Step 2: Test Agents Individually**

* Run each agent **in isolation** to confirm it behaves as expected:

  * Research Agent: Does it return relevant information?
  * Summarizer: Does it condense without losing meaning?
  * Content Writer: Is the style correct? (formal, casual, marketing, technical)
* Adjust prompts or settings if needed.

---

### **Step 3: Chain Agents Together**

* Use your orchestration tool (Flowise, Relevance AI, n8n) to **connect agents in sequence**.
* Check that the output of one agent becomes the input of the next.
* Test end-to-end with a single input.
* Example workflow:

  * Input: “Top 10 productivity tips for remote workers”
  * Research Agent: Collects tips from multiple sources.
  * Summarizer Agent: Condenses tips into 5 actionable points.
  * Content Writer Agent: Writes a blog post in 200 words with a friendly tone.

---

### **Step 4: Add Final Touches**

* Optional: Add **filters or rules** for quality control.

  * E.g., “Remove duplicate points” or “Ensure readability score < 70”.
* Add formatting instructions: bullet points, headings, tables.
* Test 2–3 variations of input to ensure robustness.

---

### **Step 5: Record Demo**

* Use **Loom, OBS, or QuickTime** to record:

  1. Your workflow interface in Flowise/Relevance AI.
  2. Input being processed.
  3. Output generation by each agent.
* Optional: Narrate each step for clarity (“This is the research agent collecting info…”).

---

### **Step 6: Document for Portfolio**

* Save screenshots or videos.
* Write a 3–5 sentence explanation:

  * Problem solved
  * How agents interact
  * Tools used
  * Result or impact
* Add this as a **case study on your portfolio site**.

---

### **Pro Tips**

* Use clear naming for each agent (ResearchBot, SummaryBot, WriterBot) — makes it look professional.
* Start with a simple workflow first; complexity can be added after you validate.
* If time allows, **add a real-world client scenario** to demonstrate practical value (e.g., summarize customer reviews for an e-commerce store).

---

✅ **Outcome for Day 60**

* A fully functional **multi-agent AI workflow**.
* Recorded demo video ready for portfolio.
* Case study write-up added to your portfolio.
* Confidence to showcase multi-agent systems to clients or on social media.

If you want, I can **design Days 61–70 with the same expanded lesson style**, showing exactly what to do for AI dashboards, no-code ML, and real business insights. This way, every day has a complete, actionable learning path.

Do you want me to do that next?
