Great — let’s zoom in on **Day 52: Install Flowise & run a sample workflow**.

### 🎯 Goal for the Day

Get **Flowise AI** up and running locally or on the cloud, and successfully test a small workflow to understand how AI pipelines (chains and agents) fit together. This day is about removing technical fear and actually *seeing* an AI workflow execute.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: What is Flowise?

Flowise is a **no-code/low-code visual builder for AI agents and workflows**. Think of it like Zapier but specifically for AI — you connect blocks (LLMs, tools, APIs, memory, knowledge bases) to design an AI pipeline.

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Setup Options

You have 3 choices to get started. Pick whichever feels easiest:

1. **Cloud (Fastest)** → Sign up for Flowise Cloud (flowiseai.com). Nothing to install, you can build workflows instantly.
2. **Local Install (Hands-on)** → If you’re comfortable running Node.js:

   ```bash
   npm install -g flowise
   flowise start
   ```

   Then open `http://localhost:3000`.
3. **Docker (For advanced users)** → Run Flowise in a container.

For no-code learners, **Cloud** is easiest.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Build Your First Workflow

Once Flowise is running:

* Drag in an **LLM Node** (like OpenAI GPT-4 or Gemini).
* Add a **Text Input Node** (user prompt).
* Connect them so input → LLM → output.
* Hit **Run** and watch it respond.

That’s the simplest workflow — but you’ll expand it later.

---

### 🛠️ Step 4: Explore a Sample “AI Agent”

To understand agents:

* Add a **Tool Node** (e.g., Google Search, Calculator, or WebScraper).
* Connect it to your LLM.
* Try a prompt like: *“What’s the latest Tesla stock price, and calculate the 10% growth target?”*
* The agent should **call the tool**, then return an answer.

This gives you a taste of how Flowise orchestrates reasoning + action.

---

### 🛠️ Step 5: Save & Document

* Save your first workflow (call it *“Day 52 Test Agent”*).
* Take a screenshot of the workflow diagram.
* Write 2–3 bullet reflections: *“What surprised me today?”*

---

### 🛠️ Step 6: Share & Build Accountability

Post something simple:

> “Today I ran my first AI workflow in Flowise — seeing an agent fetch live data + respond was mind-blowing. This feels like building the future.”

---

✅ By the end of **Day 52**, you’ll have:

* Flowise running (locally or in the cloud)
* 1 working workflow (input → LLM → output)
* 1 working agent that calls an external tool
* Documentation (screenshot + reflection)

---

Do you want me to also sketch out a **visual example workflow (diagram)** you could build on Day 52, so you can see what the nodes look like before you even open Flowise?
