Day 53 is where things start to get exciting because you’ll move beyond single prompts and simple automations into **multi-agent AI workflows**. Let me break it down so you know exactly what you’ll do and why.

### 🎯 Goal of Day 53

Build a **two-agent workflow** where one AI agent does research and another summarizes the findings. This is your first taste of chaining agents together so they behave like a team.

---

### 🔧 Tools You Can Use (No-Code Friendly)

* **Flowise** (drag-and-drop builder for AI workflows)
* **Relevance AI** (visual workflow + agent building)
* **OpenPipe or LangFlow** (if you want more control, but still low-code)

For today, Flowise is easiest to start with.

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step for Day 53

1. **Set up Flowise**

   * Go to [FlowiseAI](https://flowiseai.com) → install locally or use a cloud version (some free deployments exist).
   * Explore the canvas where you can drag nodes (think of it like a Lego board for AI).

2. **Create Agent 1: Research Agent**

   * This agent takes a topic input (e.g., “AI in healthcare 2025 trends”).
   * It uses a search tool (Google/Bing API or Tavily) to fetch articles.
   * It outputs raw research notes or article snippets.

3. **Create Agent 2: Summarizer Agent**

   * This agent takes the raw research notes from Agent 1.
   * It summarizes them into bullet points, or even a **one-page executive summary**.

4. **Chain Them Together**

   * Output of Research Agent → input for Summarizer Agent.
   * Add formatting instructions (e.g., always output in 5 bullet points).

5. **Run Your Workflow**

   * Input: “Top 5 startup trends in India 2025.”
   * Output: A neatly summarized, AI-generated research brief in seconds.

---

### 📌 Deliverable for Day 53

A working **AI workflow** where two agents collaborate:

* Research Agent = “the intern” (gathers info).
* Summarizer Agent = “the editor” (makes it clean and usable).

Save 1–2 screenshots of your Flowise canvas and 1 output summary → these go into your portfolio.

---

### 🚀 Stretch Goal (if you want to push further)

* Add a **third agent** that formats the final summary into a **LinkedIn post** or **slide deck outline**.
* That way, you’ve built your first “mini AI research assistant.”

Would you like me to **map this into a plug-and-play Flowise workflow (JSON export)** so you can import it and start right away on Day 53?
