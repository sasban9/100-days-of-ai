Great question — Day 55 in your **100 Days of AI roadmap** is all about adding an **Output Formatter Agent** to your workflow. This is the step that takes raw AI responses and makes them clean, structured, and presentation-ready.

Here’s what that means in practice:

Imagine you’ve already built a workflow in **Flowise** (or Relevance AI, or Langflow). Right now, your Research Agent pulls in data, your Summarizer Agent condenses it, and your Content Writer Agent turns it into text. The problem? The output is messy — sometimes it’s too long, sometimes it’s not in the right format, and sometimes it’s inconsistent across runs. That’s where the **Output Formatter** comes in.

On Day 55, you:

1. **Choose a standard output format.**
   For example, you might decide every workflow should return:

   * A short headline (under 10 words)
   * A 3–4 sentence summary
   * A set of action items in bullet points
   * An optional call-to-action

2. **Configure the Output Formatter Agent.**
   In Flowise, you can add a node (an LLM block) with a strict system prompt like:
   “Reformat the input into JSON with these keys: headline, summary, actions, CTA. Be concise. Do not include extra text.”

3. **Run end-to-end tests.**
   Feed different messy drafts into the formatter and check that it always outputs neat, usable results (e.g., for publishing, sending to Slack, or posting online).

4. **Save templates.**
   Create reusable “output schemas” for different needs, like blog posts, sales emails, meeting notes, or strategy briefs.

5. **Portfolio step.**
   Capture screenshots of your before-and-after outputs and document: “Here’s how I made AI workflows structured and business-ready.” This is gold when showing clients or employers.

---

So by the end of **Day 55**, you’ll have turned a rough AI pipeline into a **professional-grade workflow** that delivers **consistent, client-ready outputs** every single time.

Do you want me to sketch a **ready-to-use Output Formatter system prompt template** you can plug directly into Flowise or any no-code AI builder?
