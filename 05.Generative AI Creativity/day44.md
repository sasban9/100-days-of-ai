Let me break it down for you in detail so that you don‚Äôt just ‚Äútry it‚Äù but actually walk away with something you can showcase.

### üé¨ **Day 44: Your First AI Video with Runway Gen-3**

**Goal:** Create your first short AI-generated video (5‚Äì10 seconds) that looks polished enough to share.

---

#### Step 1. Setup & Explore

* Sign up at [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com) if you haven‚Äôt.
* Explore the Gen-3 workspace: you‚Äôll see options like *Text to Video*, *Image to Video*, *Video to Video*.
* Watch a 5-minute tutorial from Runway‚Äôs own help center or YouTube to orient yourself.

---

#### Step 2. Text-to-Video Basics

* Write a short, vivid prompt. Think cinematic, not vague.
  Example: *‚ÄúA cyberpunk city at night, neon lights reflecting on wet streets, cinematic camera pan, ultra-realistic.‚Äù*
* Keep the length short (5‚Äì10 sec) ‚Äî the system performs best with concise prompts.
* Run it and download the first draft.

---

#### Step 3. Experiment with Variations

* Try at least 3 different styles:

  1. **Realistic cinematic** (film-like, moody lighting)
  2. **Stylized animation** (cartoon, anime, watercolor, claymation)
  3. **Conceptual/abstract** (surreal, dreamlike, futuristic visuals)
* Notice how prompt wording changes output (e.g., ‚Äúin Pixar style‚Äù vs ‚Äúphotorealistic‚Äù).

---

#### Step 4. Enhance with Image-to-Video

* Pick a still image you like (maybe from MidJourney, Day 41).
* Use *Image-to-Video* to make it move (e.g., add camera zoom-in, background animation).
* This is powerful for brand logos, illustrations, or mock ads.

---

#### Step 5. Add Audio

* AI video feels empty without sound. Use **Suno** or **Udio** (from Day 46) to generate a background track.
* Or grab a free audio from [Pixabay Music](https://pixabay.com/music/) or YouTube Audio Library.
* Sync it using CapCut or Descript (both are beginner-friendly).

---

#### Step 6. Publish Your Mini Reel

* Export as a short 9:16 video (TikTok/Instagram Reels format).
* Post with a caption like: *‚ÄúMy first AI-generated video using Runway Gen-3. Created from text prompts in under 10 minutes. Imagine the future of filmmaking.‚Äù*

---

‚úÖ By the end of Day 44, you‚Äôll have:

* 1 short cinematic AI video from text
* 1 stylized/creative variation
* 1 animated image (logo/illustration in motion)
* A finished mini-reel with music
