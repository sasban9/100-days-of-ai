Great — let’s zoom in on **Day 47: Generate a voiceover with ElevenLabs**.

Here’s how you can approach it step by step so you don’t just try the tool, but actually get something useful and portfolio-worthy out of it:

### 🎙️ What You’ll Do

You’ll create an **AI-generated voiceover** using ElevenLabs (or similar tools like Play.ht, WellSaid, or OpenAI’s new text-to-speech). The goal is to take any written script — ad copy, explainer, or even your own “intro video narration” — and turn it into a natural-sounding voiceover.

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Sign Up & Explore Voices**

   * Go to [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io).
   * Sign up for a free account.
   * Browse their **Voice Library**. Test at least 3 voices (male, female, neutral).

2. **Prepare Your Script**

   * Write a **30–60 second script**. A good test could be:

     * An ad for your AI toolkit.
     * A narration for your portfolio intro video.
     * A sample podcast snippet.

   Example: “Welcome to my AI journey. Over the last 100 days, I built apps, chatbots, and creative tools — all powered by AI…”

3. **Generate & Refine**

   * Paste script → pick a voice → select “high quality” generation.
   * Adjust speed, pitch, and emotion sliders to make it sound natural.
   * Download the MP3/WAV file.

4. **Experiment with Custom Voices**

   * If you have access to the **Voice Cloning** feature, record 1–2 minutes of your real voice and upload it.
   * Test how your cloned voice reads your script.
   * Compare: AI narrator vs your own cloned voice.

5. **Integrate Voiceover into Content**

   * Add the voiceover to a short AI-generated video (from Day 44 or 45).
   * Use free tools like **CapCut** or **Descript** to sync voice with visuals.

6. **Publish & Showcase**

   * Create a mini-reel: “Here’s a commercial voiceover I made with AI.”
   * Post it on LinkedIn/Twitter/YouTube Shorts with a line like:
     *“Instead of hiring a \$300 voice actor, I made this in 5 minutes using AI.”*

### 🌟 Why This Matters

* Adds **audio dimension** to your AI portfolio (most people stop at text/images).
* Opens up opportunities in **ads, podcasting, e-learning, explainer videos**.
* If you later combine this with Day 46 (music) and Day 44/45 (video), you can literally produce full commercials or learning content solo.
