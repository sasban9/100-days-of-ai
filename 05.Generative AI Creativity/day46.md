Day 46 is where we step into **AI-generated music**, and the focus is on tools like **Suno AI** and **Udio**. The idea isn’t to become a professional music producer, but to understand how AI can generate original audio assets you can use for content, branding, or even client projects.

Here’s how you can approach it:

### **1. Set up accounts**

* Go to [suno.ai](https://suno.ai) and [udio.com](https://www.udio.com). Both let you generate songs with just text prompts.
* Free tiers usually give you a few generations per day, which is plenty for experimentation.

### **2. Explore prompt styles**

* Start simple: “A calming ambient background track with soft piano and ocean waves.”
* Try different genres: “An upbeat funk track with saxophone and bassline.”
* Test commercial use prompts: “A 30-second jingle for a coffee brand, cheerful and catchy.”

Notice how Suno tends to generate full songs with lyrics and vocals, while Udio is strong at giving polished, professional-sounding instrumentals.

### **3. Practical experiments**

* Generate a **short background loop** you could use in a YouTube intro.
* Make a **brand jingle** for a fictional product (say, “EcoBottle” water bottle ad).
* Create a **theme song** for your AI challenge journey.

### **4. Add light editing**

* Use a free tool like **Audacity** or **Descript** to trim, loop, or fade in/out.
* If you want to experiment with layering, try **Soundtrap** (web-based DAW) and mix AI tracks together.

### **5. Portfolio integration**

* Save your best 2–3 tracks.
* Showcase them as part of your “AI Brand Kit” (you’ll use them again on Day 48).
* Post one track publicly with a caption like:
  *“Experimenting with AI-generated music using Suno/Udio — here’s a jingle I made in 5 minutes.”*

### **Why Day 46 matters**

By adding music to your AI toolkit, you’re no longer just building apps or chatbots — you’re creating full sensory experiences. This skill is surprisingly valuable for small businesses, creators, and startups who want quick, affordable audio branding.
