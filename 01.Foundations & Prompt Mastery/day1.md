Great — let’s go deep into **Day 1 of your 100 Days of AI journey**. Think of today as “setting the stage” while also giving you hands-on wins.

# **Day 1: Explore AI Tools & Compare Outputs**

### 🎯 Goal

Get familiar with the “big three” AI assistants of 2025 (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), experience their different styles, and start building your **AI comparison journal**.

---

### 🪜 Step 1: Set Up Accounts

* **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** → [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/)
* **Claude (Anthropic)** → [https://claude.ai/](https://claude.ai/)
* **Gemini (Google)** → [https://gemini.google.com/](https://gemini.google.com/)

Sign in with Google/Email. Free tiers are enough for now.

---

### 🪜 Step 2: Warm-Up Prompts

Ask each model the **exact same 3 questions**:

1. *“Explain quantum computing in simple terms for a 10-year-old.”*
2. *“Give me 5 business ideas I can start with no money.”*
3. *“Write a 2-day meal plan for someone who wants high-protein vegetarian food.”*

Copy-paste their answers into a Google Doc or Notion page.

---

### 🪜 Step 3: Compare Outputs

Look at how each tool:

* Explains (short vs long, formal vs friendly).
* Structures (lists, paragraphs, tables).
* Adds creativity (unique ideas, analogies).

Write 3–4 notes for each: what you liked, what felt weak.

---

### 🪜 Step 4: Try a Personal Task

Pick **one real problem** from your life today. For example:

* Drafting a WhatsApp message.
* Summarizing a long email.
* Creating a workout routine.
* Planning a 2-day weekend trip.

Ask all three models the same thing. Choose the response you’d actually use.

---

### 🪜 Step 5: Start Your AI Journal

Open a Notion/Google Doc with 3 sections:

* **Prompts I Tried** (paste them in).
* **Best Output of the Day** (screenshot/copy).
* **Notes** (who performed better and why).

This becomes your personal **AI Benchmark Log** — you’ll keep adding daily.

---

### 🪜 Step 6: Share a Micro-Win

Post on LinkedIn, Twitter, or even WhatsApp:
*"Day 1 of my 100 Days of AI — tested ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Interesting how each one has a different personality. Excited to see what else I’ll build!"*

Sharing early keeps you accountable and visible.

---

✅ **End of Day 1 Deliverables**

* Accounts created on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini.
* 3–5 prompts tested in all three.
* Notes on differences in style.
* AI Journal started.
* First micro-post shared publicly.

Would you like me to design a **Day 1 worksheet template** (like a PDF with spaces to paste outputs, tick boxes, and write reflections) so you can literally print/fill it in?
