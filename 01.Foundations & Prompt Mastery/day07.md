Great — let’s go deeper into **Day 7: Cross-test same prompts in ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini**.

The goal of this day is to **understand how different AI models think, write, and specialize**, so you know which to use for which kind of task. It’s like building your personal “AI taste map.”

### **Step 1: Prepare a Test Prompt Set (5 categories)**

Choose 5 prompts, one from each category below:

1. **Creative Writing** – “Write a bedtime story for a 5-year-old about a robot who learns kindness.”
2. **Business Writing** – “Draft a cold email offering AI automation services to a small restaurant.”
3. **Analytical Thinking** – “Explain how inflation affects small businesses, in simple terms.”
4. **Technical/Instructional** – “Create a step-by-step guide to build a simple landing page in HTML/CSS.”
5. **Conversational Roleplay** – “Act as a fitness coach and design a 7-day home workout plan.”

---

### **Step 2: Run the Same Prompts in Each Model**

* Open **ChatGPT (GPT-4/5)**, **Claude 3.5 (Anthropic)**, and **Gemini Advanced (Google)**.
* Paste the same 5 prompts into each.
* Save outputs into a doc (Notion/Word/Google Doc).

---

### **Step 3: Compare by Criteria**

Create a table and rank them (1–5 stars) for each prompt. Use these dimensions:

* **Clarity**: Is the answer easy to understand?
* **Creativity**: Does it feel fresh, original, or human-like?
* **Depth/Reasoning**: Does it explain or just give surface answers?
* **Structure/Formatting**: Are outputs organized (lists, tables, headings)?
* **Usefulness to you**: Does it feel actionable and usable?

Example (for Prompt 1: Story):

| Model   | Clarity | Creativity | Depth | Formatting | Usefulness |
| ------- | ------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| ChatGPT | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |
| Claude  | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐      |
| Gemini  | ⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐        |

---

### **Step 4: Reflect & Build Notes**

After testing all 5 prompts, write **1–2 takeaways per model**.
Example:

* **ChatGPT** → Great at structure & explanations, best for technical guides.
* **Claude** → Amazing creativity and empathy, best for coaching, writing, roleplay.
* **Gemini** → Strong at factual recall & integration with Google services, but weaker in style.

### **Step 5: Save as a Personal “Model Map”**

Put your notes into your **Prompt Playbook** (from Day 8/9). This way, whenever you have a new task, you’ll instantly know which AI is the best “tool.”

---

💡 Pro tip: Repeat this test every **3 months**. Models evolve fast, and you’ll notice big improvements (or shifts) in behavior.

Would you like me to design this as a **ready-to-use template (table + notes section)** you can just copy into Notion/Google Docs, so you don’t waste time setting it up?
