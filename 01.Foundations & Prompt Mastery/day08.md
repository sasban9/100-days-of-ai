Great choice — Day 8 is where your **Prompt Playbook** starts to become your personal “AI operating system.” Let’s expand it so you know exactly what to do.

# 📘 **Day 8: Building Your Prompt Playbook (Part 1)**

### 🎯 Goal:

Create a **living document** of your 10 best prompts across different areas of your life and work. This will be the foundation you’ll expand and refine over the next 100 days.

---

### 🛠 Tools to Use:

* **Notion** (best for organizing + tagging)
* **Google Docs / Word** (simpler, if you just want text)
* **Obsidian / Evernote** (if you like linked notes)

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Choose your categories (5 to start)**
Pick areas of life/business where you’ll use AI regularly. For example:

1. Productivity & Planning
2. Writing & Content Creation
3. Research & Learning
4. Business & Strategy
5. Personal Life (health, fitness, travel, habits)

**Step 2: Write 2 solid prompts per category (10 total)**
Don’t just write vague prompts — write “ready-to-use” instructions. Example:

* *Productivity:*
  “Act as a productivity coach. I’ll describe my to-do list, and you’ll organize it into priority levels with a daily schedule, highlighting tasks I can automate or delegate.”

* *Writing:*
  “You are an editor for Harvard Business Review. Rewrite the following draft in a professional, engaging, and concise tone suitable for industry leaders.”

* *Research:*
  “Summarize this article in 3 formats: a 1-sentence takeaway, a 5-bullet digest, and a 200-word analysis.”

* *Business:*
  “Imagine you are a growth strategist for a SaaS startup. Generate 5 go-to-market strategies, ranked by ease of execution and ROI.”

* *Personal Life:*
  “Act as a travel guide for \[destination]. Suggest a 3-day itinerary with must-see attractions, hidden gems, and food options under \$30/day.”

**Step 3: Test each prompt**
Run all 10 prompts in ChatGPT (or Claude/Gemini too) and see which ones give you the best results. Copy the best version into your Playbook.

**Step 4: Format your Playbook for quick use**
For each prompt, include:

* **Prompt Title** (e.g., “Travel Guide Generator”)
* **Exact Prompt Text**
* **Example Output** (paste one result you liked)
* **Tags** (e.g., #writing #strategy #personal)

**Step 5: Make it accessible**

* Save as a Notion page with a **table view** (columns for Title / Prompt / Example / Category).
* Add an “AI Prompts” bookmark folder in your browser for quick copy-paste.
* If you like physical things → print Day 8 prompts as a “cheat sheet.”

---

### 🌟 Bonus Challenges (optional if you’re ahead of time):

* Share 1–2 prompts on LinkedIn/Twitter to start building your “AI credibility.”
* Compare results between ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini for the same prompt → note differences in your Playbook.
* Add a “Prompt Improvement” column → write down tweaks that made the response better.

---

💡 By the end of Day 8, you’ll have a **working set of 10 killer prompts** you can rely on daily, instead of reinventing the wheel every time. Over time, this Playbook will grow into 50–100 prompts — basically your **AI Swiss Army Knife**.

Do you want me to actually **design a Notion template** for this Prompt Playbook so you can just duplicate it and start filling it in?
