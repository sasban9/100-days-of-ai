Great choice — **Day 4 is where you learn prompt formatting**, which is one of the fastest ways to make AI outputs more structured and business-ready. Let’s break it down step by step so you don’t just “learn” it but actually build muscle memory.

## 🔹 **Day 4 Expanded Plan — Mastering Prompt Formatting**

**Goal:** Learn how to control AI outputs with structure (tables, JSON, bullet lists, sections). End result: you’ll have a “Prompt Formatting Cheatsheet” you can reuse in business and automation.

---

### **Step 1: Warm-up (30 mins)**

* Open ChatGPT (or Claude/Gemini).
* Ask a vague question like:
  *“Tell me about top 5 startup ideas in healthcare.”*
* Notice how the AI gives you a mix of text, maybe unordered, sometimes hard to reuse.

Now you’ll **re-prompt with structure**.

---

### **Step 2: Experiment with Output Styles (1 hr)**

1. **Bullet List**

   * Prompt:
     *“List 5 startup ideas in healthcare. Format as a clean bullet list with short, one-line descriptions.”*

2. **Numbered List with Details**

   * Prompt:
     *“List 5 startup ideas in healthcare. Number them 1–5. For each, include: idea name, target users, monetization model.”*

3. **Table Format**

   * Prompt:
     *“Create a table with 4 columns: Idea, Target Users, Problem Solved, Revenue Model. Fill it with 5 healthcare startup ideas.”*

4. **JSON Format**

   * Prompt:
     *“Give me 5 healthcare startup ideas in valid JSON. Use keys: ‘idea’, ‘users’, ‘problem’, ‘model’.”*
   * This is extremely useful for no-code automations where JSON feeds into tools.

5. **Sectioned Report**

   * Prompt:
     *“Write a mini-report on 5 healthcare startup ideas. Use these sections for each idea: Overview, Target Users, Problem Solved, Revenue Model, Risks.”*

---

### **Step 3: Save Outputs (30 mins)**

* Copy your best 2–3 formatted outputs into your **Prompt Playbook** (Google Doc/Notion).
* Title them like: “Startup Ideas → Table Format,” “Startup Ideas → JSON Format.”
* Add short notes on **when to use each format** (e.g., tables for presentations, JSON for automation, reports for clients).

---

### **Step 4: Business Application Drill (1 hr)**

Pick **one real scenario** you’d face:

* If you’re in career track → job interview prep.
* If you’re in business track → customer research.

Example business prompt:
*“List top 10 customer pain points in real estate. Format as a table with columns: Pain Point, Customer Type, Potential AI Solution, Estimated Impact.”*

Example career prompt:
*“Generate 10 interview questions for a project manager role. Format as JSON with keys: question, difficulty\_level, topic.”*

---

### **Step 5: Reflection & Sharing (15 mins)**

* Write 3 sentences: What changed when I forced structure into AI outputs?
* Post a screenshot on LinkedIn/Twitter: “Today I learned how to turn messy AI answers into structured outputs I can reuse.”

✅ **End of Day 4 Deliverables:**

1. At least 5 prompt experiments (bullet list, numbered list, table, JSON, sectioned report).
2. A mini **Prompt Formatting Cheatsheet** in your Playbook.
3. One real-world business/career example formatted and saved.
4. Optional: a public post sharing one formatted output.

Do you want me to actually **design the “Prompt Formatting Cheatsheet” template** for you (with space for your own examples), so you can just fill it in as you practice?
