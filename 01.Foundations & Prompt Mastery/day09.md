Great choice. **Day 9** is where your prompt library starts becoming a real *asset* instead of scattered experiments. Let’s expand it into a structured, practical session.

# 🔍 Day 9 – Expand Prompt Playbook to 20 Prompts with Examples

**Goal:** Move from a rough list of prompts into a structured playbook you can actually reuse, adapt, and share. By the end of today, you’ll have a categorized collection of 20 strong prompts with tested examples and outputs.

---

### Step 1. Organize into Categories

Divide your prompts into 4 categories (5 each):

1. **Productivity & Personal Life** (task planning, summarization, habit coaching)
2. **Business & Work** (marketing, research, customer service, content writing)
3. **Creativity & Ideation** (storytelling, brainstorming, design)
4. **Technical & Learning** (coding help, data analysis, skill learning)

---

### Step 2. Refine Each Prompt

For each category, write 5 prompts. Make sure:

* They are specific (avoid “Write me an article” → try “Write a 300-word LinkedIn post in an inspiring but professional tone for young entrepreneurs”).
* They include context and role (“You are a project manager for a tech startup…”).
* They have formatting instructions (“Give output as a table with columns: task, deadline, priority”).

---

### Step 3. Add Examples

For each prompt, capture:

* **Prompt** (what you asked)
* **Expected Output** (short sample result)
* **Notes** (what worked well, what to tweak)

Example:

* **Prompt:** “Summarize this meeting transcript into 3 bullet points with action items in a table format.”
* **Expected Output:** A 2-column table with “Task” and “Owner.”
* **Notes:** Works best if transcript is pasted in chunks <3000 words.

---

### Step 4. Build in Notion or Google Doc

* Create a 4-section layout.
* Each section has 5 prompts + mini case example.
* Add quick tags like **#marketing #summarize #formatting** for easy reference.

---

### Step 5. Share One “Gem” Prompt Publicly

Pick the most impressive one and post it online. Example:
“Today I tested a prompt that turns a messy 3-page transcript into an action list in under 30 seconds. Here’s the structure I used 👇 \[share prompt].”

This creates visibility *and* accountability.

---

✅ **End of Day 9 Outcome:** A structured **Prompt Playbook v1 (20 prompts)** that you can:

* Reuse daily.
* Improve over time.
* Share with clients/friends to showcase your AI expertise.

Do you want me to actually **draft 20 prompts across those 4 categories** so you can copy-paste them straight into your playbook, or would you like to co-create them with your personal goals in mind?
