Great choice — **Day 6: Chain-of-Thought Prompting** is one of the most powerful skills to master early, because it changes AI from giving you surface-level answers into becoming a structured reasoning engine. Let’s expand this day into a full mini-workshop.

## 🔎 **Day 6: Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

### Goal:

Learn how to guide AI step by step so it explains reasoning before giving an answer.

---

### Step 1: Understand the concept

Chain-of-thought prompting means instead of asking:

> “What’s 23 × 47?”

You ask:

> “Solve this step by step. First, multiply 20 × 47. Then add 3 × 47. Then give the final sum.”

The AI doesn’t jump to the final result. It “thinks aloud” like a tutor showing work. This makes answers **more accurate and transparent**.

---

### Step 2: Try simple math reasoning

Prompt:

> “Solve 38 × 25 step by step.”

Watch how AI breaks it down. Then, remove “step by step” and see how different the output looks. Compare both.

---

### Step 3: Apply to logic problems

Prompt:

> “If I have 5 apples and I give 2 to Sarah, then buy 7 more, how many do I have now? Explain step by step.”

Without chain-of-thought, AI might miscalculate. With it, the reasoning path is clear.

---

### Step 4: Apply to business decisions

Prompt:

> “I run an online course business. My sales dropped from 1000 enrollments to 700 in 2 months. Break down possible reasons step by step before suggesting solutions.”

AI will list causes (marketing, competition, seasonality, pricing) and then structured solutions.

---

### Step 5: Apply to creative tasks

Prompt:

> “I want 5 startup ideas in the food industry. Think step by step: 1) list customer problems, 2) brainstorm solutions, 3) select the most scalable one, 4) explain why it works.”

This forces AI into **structured ideation**, not just random ideas.

---

### Step 6: Save reusable prompt templates

By the end of today, add at least **3 chain-of-thought prompt templates** to your **Prompt Playbook**. Example:

* **Problem Solving Template**:
  “Let’s solve this step by step. First, restate the problem. Second, list assumptions. Third, calculate or reason. Finally, give the answer.”

* **Decision-Making Template**:
  “Break this problem into steps: identify the issue, analyze 3 causes, suggest 3 solutions, then recommend the best one.”

* **Creative Template**:
  “Generate ideas step by step: find problems, brainstorm solutions, filter by scalability, then finalize.”

---

✅ **By end of Day 6** you’ll:

* Understand chain-of-thought prompting.
* Have tested it in math, logic, business, and creativity.
* Added 3 templates into your playbook.

Do you want me to also expand Day 6 into a **hands-on worksheet** (like a guided PDF where you fill in AI outputs for each step), so it becomes interactive practice rather than just theory?
