Here are 5 model prompts you can use right away (feel free to copy–edit to your life).

**1. Time & Schedule**

> “You are my productivity coach. I work from 9–6, have 2 hours for deep work, and need 1 hour for exercise. Create a daily schedule that balances focus work, meetings, breaks, and personal time.”

**2. Meals & Nutrition**

> “I am a 40-year-old male, 90 kg, living in Silchar. Suggest a 7-day meal plan rich in vegetables, including fish and eggs, with easy-to-make dishes common in Indian kitchens.”

**3. Fitness & Health**

> “You are my personal trainer. Design a 20-minute home workout for strength and flexibility, using no equipment. Provide step-by-step instructions.”

**4. Learning & Study**

> “Act as my study buddy. Summarize the key points of \[insert article/topic] in a way that’s easy to understand, and quiz me with 5 questions at the end.”

### 📌 Step 3: Run & Refine

Paste each prompt into ChatGPT (or Claude/Gemini). Notice:

* Are outputs **too generic**? Add more detail.
* Are they **too long**? Ask: “Keep response under 150 words.”
* Do you want **tables/lists**? Add formatting instructions.

---

### 📌 Step 4: Save to Your Playbook

Make a **Google Doc / Notion page** called *Personal Prompt Library*.

* Save the 5 prompts.
* Add one best output from each as an “example response.”

### 📌 Step 5: Bonus Challenge
