Great choice. Day 5 is all about **role prompting** — one of the most powerful ways to get better AI outputs. Let’s go deep so you have a clear step-by-step exercise.

# 🔹 **Day 5: Role Prompting Mastery**

### 🎯 Goal for Today

Learn how to make AI behave like a specific role (teacher, coach, HR manager, lawyer, designer, etc.) so its responses match professional standards.

---

### 🪄 Why It Matters

AI without context often gives “generic” answers. But when you assign a role, it adopts **tone, expertise, and responsibility**, producing outputs closer to what you’d get from a real professional. This is the bridge between “toy” AI and **business-ready AI**.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Understand the Formula

A role prompt usually has 3 layers:

1. **Role:** “You are an expert career coach with 15 years of experience.”
2. **Task:** “Help me prepare for a job interview for a product manager role.”
3. **Constraints:** “Give me 5 questions and answers. Keep each answer under 100 words.”

---

### ✅ Step 2: Try 3 Roles Today

Pick **3 roles you’d actually find useful**. Example set:

1. **HR Manager** → for interview prep, performance review templates.
2. **Marketing Strategist** → for campaign ideas.
3. **Fitness Coach** → for personalized daily routines.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Run Experiments

For each role:

1. Ask a simple question.

   * *HR Manager:* “How would you design a 90-day onboarding plan for a new software engineer?”
   * *Marketing Strategist:* “Plan a 3-day social media campaign for a new café.”
   * *Fitness Coach:* “Design a workout plan for someone who has 30 minutes a day and no gym equipment.”
2. Compare the quality vs. asking the same question *without a role*.
3. Note the differences in **tone, detail, and professionalism**.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Push the Boundaries

Refine your prompt by adding **expertise levels** or **constraints**. For example:

* “You are a Harvard MBA professor teaching marketing strategy. Explain this as if I’m an undergrad.”
* “You are a startup CTO. Design a product roadmap in a table with 3 milestones.”
* “You are a personal trainer. Build a workout plan with only yoga + bodyweight moves, 20 minutes per day.”

---

### ✅ Step 5: Document in Playbook

* Save your 3 best prompts from today into your **Prompt Playbook**.
* Add notes on which tweaks improved results (like “adding years of experience made answers more detailed”).

---

### ✅ Stretch Goal

Create a **multi-role prompt** where AI plays 2 roles at once. Example:
“You are both a startup investor and a customer. First, evaluate my business pitch as an investor. Then, switch roles and evaluate as a potential user.”

This gives you layered feedback in one go.

---

### 🔑 Output by End of Day

* At least **3 role prompts** tested.
* 1 multi-role prompt experiment.
* Updated Prompt Playbook with learnings.
