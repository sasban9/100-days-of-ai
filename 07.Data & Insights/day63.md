Great — let’s dive deep into **Day 63**. At this stage, you’ve already tried **Akkio** (Day 61–62), so today is about exploring **ObviouslyAI**, comparing its ease-of-use, and starting to think critically about **which no-code AI tool fits different business use cases**.

---

## **Day 63 — Lesson Expansion: ObviouslyAI Exploration**

### **Goal**

By the end of today, you will:

1. Have hands-on experience with **ObviouslyAI**.
2. Compare it directly against **Akkio** (your Day 62 tool).
3. Write down at least **3 criteria** for choosing the right no-code ML tool for a business use case.

---

### **Step 1: Set Up ObviouslyAI**

* Sign up for a free or trial account at **[obviously.ai](https://obviously.ai)**.
* Upload the **same dataset** you used in Akkio (e.g., sales data, churn dataset, or customer leads).

  * If you don’t have one, use the **sample datasets provided inside the platform** (such as Titanic survival, bank churn, or loan approvals).

---

### **Step 2: Explore Features**

* Test the core workflow:

  1. Upload data.
  2. Select a **target variable** (e.g., “Will the customer churn?”).
  3. Run predictions.
  4. Review accuracy and feature importance.
* Check how ObviouslyAI handles:

  * **Data prep:** Do you need to clean/format, or is it auto-handled?
  * **Insights:** Does it explain the model in plain English?
  * **Speed:** How quickly can you go from upload → prediction?

---

### **Step 3: Run a Use Case**

Choose a simple business problem to solve today. Example scenarios:

* **Sales:** Predict which leads are most likely to convert.
* **Customer service:** Predict which customers will churn.
* **Finance:** Predict loan approvals or defaults.
* **HR:** Predict which employees are at risk of leaving.

Steps:

1. Pick target variable.
2. Let ObviouslyAI auto-train the model.
3. Review predictions + explanations.

---

### **Step 4: Compare with Akkio**

Open your notes from Day 62 (Akkio test) and compare:

* **Ease of use:** Was the UI simpler in Akkio or ObviouslyAI?
* **Speed:** Which tool gave you results faster?
* **Explainability:** Which one gave better plain-language insights?
* **Integrations:** Which tool had better export/sharing options (Google Sheets, API, Zapier, etc.)?
* **Pricing:** Which one seems more affordable for a small business?

---

### **Step 5: Document Learnings**

Write a short reflection (in Notion, Google Doc, or your portfolio log):

* Problem tested: *(e.g., predicting churn)*
* Dataset used: *(e.g., customer churn sample)*
* Tool comparison: Akkio vs ObviouslyAI → strengths and weaknesses.
* When you’d use each: *(e.g., Akkio for dashboards, ObviouslyAI for quick predictions)*.

---

### **Step 6: Share Publicly**

Post on LinkedIn/Twitter:

* “Today I tested **ObviouslyAI**, a no-code ML tool. Compared to Akkio, I found it better for \_\_\_, but weaker in \_\_\_. Here’s a quick screenshot of my churn prediction model.”
* This builds credibility and shows your journey.

---

✅ **Outcome for Day 63**

* Hands-on project in **ObviouslyAI**.
* Side-by-side comparison with Akkio.
* Documented reflection in your AI portfolio.
* A public “learning in public” post (optional, but highly recommended).
