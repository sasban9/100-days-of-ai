Got it — let’s deep dive into **Day 70**. This is a **milestone day** because it marks the end of the **Data & Insights sprint (Days 61–70)**. By today, you should be comfortable using **no-code AI tools for predictive analytics and dashboards**. The goal is to **showcase your first real “AI data product”**.

# **Day 70 — Lesson Expansion: Build & Share a No-Code AI Dashboard**

### **Goal**

By the end of the day, you’ll have:

1. A polished **AI-powered dashboard** built with a no-code platform (Akkio, ObviouslyAI, or Rows).
2. A clear **business story/case study** that explains what the dashboard shows and why it matters.
3. A **public share** (LinkedIn, portfolio, or video demo) announcing your progress.

---

### **Step 1: Select Your Dataset**

* Use a **realistic business dataset** (not just toy data). Options:

  * **Sales data**: dates, regions, products, revenue, returns.
  * **Customer data**: demographics, churn, support tickets.
  * **Marketing data**: ad spend, impressions, conversions.
  * **E-commerce data**: orders, categories, repeat purchases.
* If you don’t have your own data, download free CSVs from Kaggle or Google’s datasets.
* **Tip**: Pick a dataset that answers a **business question** (e.g., “What predicts customer churn?” or “Which product drives most revenue?”).

---

### **Step 2: Import to No-Code AI Tool**

* Open **Akkio (recommended)**.
* Import your dataset via **CSV or Google Sheets**.
* Explore **auto-generated insights** (trends, correlations, anomalies).
* Try ObviouslyAI for comparison (different UI, sometimes faster insights).

---

### **Step 3: Build a Predictive Model**

* Define your **target variable**:

  * For sales data → predict **next month’s revenue**.
  * For customer data → predict **likelihood of churn**.
  * For marketing → predict **conversion probability**.
* Train the no-code model with 1 click.
* Review accuracy (Akkio gives model performance, feature importance).
* Note which variables **influence predictions most** (this is your “AI insight”).

---

### **Step 4: Build a Dashboard**

* Use Akkio’s built-in **dashboard generator**.
* Include:

  * **KPIs** (revenue, churn %, conversion rate).
  * **Graphs** (sales over time, top products, customer segments).
  * **Predictive Widget** (e.g., enter customer data → AI predicts churn risk).
* Customize dashboard title & branding.
* Test it with sample queries.

---

### **Step 5: Add Business Storytelling**

Raw dashboards are boring — give them **context**:

* Write a short **executive summary**:

  * “This dashboard helps identify at-risk customers before they churn.”
  * “We can see that repeat purchase rate drives 70% of long-term sales.”
  * “By predicting conversion, we can allocate ad spend 30% more effectively.”
* Add 2–3 **“so what” insights** that a business person would care about.

---

### **Step 6: Share Publicly**

* **Option 1: Demo video** — record a Loom where you walk through the dashboard and explain findings.
* **Option 2: LinkedIn/Twitter post** —

  > “Day 70 of my 100 Days of AI. Built a no-code AI dashboard that predicts customer churn with 82% accuracy. Here’s how I did it 👇”
* **Option 3: Portfolio update** — add the dashboard link + case study.

---

### **Step 7: Stretch Challenge (Optional)**

* Connect your dashboard to **live data** (Google Sheets auto-refresh).
* Create a **scenario simulator** (e.g., “What if ad spend increases 20%?”).
* Offer to test it with a **real small business** (freelance outreach).

---

✅ **Outcome for Day 70**

* Working AI dashboard (with predictive analytics).
* Written business case (problem + insights + results).
* Public proof of skill (post, demo, or case study).
* A **portfolio milestone** showing you can turn raw data into real business value.

Do you want me to now **expand Days 61–70 as a whole series** (like I did for Day 60 and 70), so you’ll have a full **step-by-step lesson plan for the entire Data & Insights sprint**?
