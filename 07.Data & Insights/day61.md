Great — let’s expand **Day 61**. This is where you start transitioning from multi-agent workflows into **AI data & insights**. The focus today is to get comfortable with a no-code ML platform like **Akkio** so you can build predictive models and dashboards without touching code.

# **Day 61 — Lesson Expansion: First No-Code ML Model (Akkio)**

### **Goal**

By the end of today, you’ll have uploaded a dataset, explored it with AI insights, and trained your **first predictive model** — all without writing code.

---

### **Step 1: Sign Up & Explore Interface**

* Go to **[akkio.com](https://akkio.com/)** and create a free account.
* Walk through the onboarding demo — it usually shows a sample sales dataset and how predictions are made.
* Familiarize yourself with the dashboard: **Datasets, Models, Insights, Deployments**.

---

### **Step 2: Choose a Dataset**

Pick one of these:

* Use Akkio’s **sample datasets** (like sales leads, churn, or marketing performance).
* Or upload a **Google Sheet/CSV** with simple data (sales by month, customer attributes, expenses).

Example if using sales data:

* Columns: `Lead Source`, `Company Size`, `Budget`, `Converted (Yes/No)`

---

### **Step 3: Explore with AI Insights**

* Click **“Explore Data”** → Akkio’s AI will automatically highlight patterns.
* Ask:

  * What variables are most correlated with conversion?
  * Which customers are likely to churn?
  * Which channels bring highest ROI?
* Note at least **3 insights** — this is your first data storytelling step.

---

### **Step 4: Train Your First Model**

* Click **“Predict”** → select a target column (e.g., `Converted`, `Churned`, `Revenue`).
* Let Akkio train automatically.
* Review **Model Performance Metrics**:

  * Accuracy / F1 score
  * Feature importance (which factors matter most)

---

### **Step 5: Test Predictions**

* Enter a few **manual test cases**:

  * Example: A lead from LinkedIn, \$50k budget, 200 employees → does model predict “High chance of conversion”?
* Save at least 3 test predictions.

---

### **Step 6: Create a Simple Dashboard**

* Use Akkio’s drag-and-drop **dashboard builder**.
* Add widgets like:

  * “Top 3 factors driving conversion”
  * “Predicted revenue by channel”
  * “High-value vs low-value customers”
* Export dashboard as a **shareable link**.

---

### **Step 7: Document the Case Study**

Write down:

* Problem: “Predict which sales leads will convert.”
* Tools: Akkio (no-code ML).
* Dataset: \[Describe briefly].
* Result: Model achieved X% accuracy, with \[Factor A, Factor B] as top predictors.
* Visual: Screenshot of dashboard.

---

### **Step 8: Portfolio & Sharing**

* Add this to your **portfolio under ‘AI for Business Insights.’**
* Share a post:

  > “Today I trained my first no-code ML model in Akkio. It predicts which customers are most likely to convert. Accuracy: 82%. No coding required. 🚀”

---

✅ **Outcome for Day 61**

* First **end-to-end ML project** (dataset → model → dashboard).
* Case study documented for your portfolio.
* Experience with **AI-assisted data exploration**.

Do you want me to also **expand Day 62** in the same style (predictive sales forecast project in Akkio), so you see how the roadmap builds project by project?
