Great choice — Day 68 is where your **AI dashboard project** becomes real and visible. By this stage, you’ve already played with Akkio/ObviouslyAI, built a dataset-based model, and made some insights. Day 68 is all about **turning that into a polished, presentable demo**. Let’s break it down in detail.

## **Day 68 — Expanded Lesson: Recording Your AI Dashboard Demo**

### 🎯 **Goal**

By the end of today, you’ll have a **professional demo video** of your AI dashboard that clearly shows:

1. The problem you’re solving.
2. The dataset behind it.
3. The AI-generated insights/predictions.
4. Why it’s useful for a business.

This becomes **portfolio gold** — easy to share on LinkedIn, in proposals, or with clients.

---

### **Step 1: Polish the Dashboard**

* Open your AI dashboard (Akkio, ObviouslyAI, or Google Data Studio if you exported it).
* Make sure the **layout is clean**:

  * No raw column names like `cust_id` or `ord_amt`. Rename to “Customer ID” and “Order Amount”.
  * Use **clear chart types** (bar, line, pie) instead of confusing scatterplots unless necessary.
  * Add a headline/label to each chart: “Sales Over Time”, “Top 5 Customer Segments”.
* Run one or two queries and confirm insights look believable.

👉 Example: If your dataset is e-commerce orders, highlight insights like:

* “High-value customers are mostly 25–34 years old.”
* “Churn risk increases after 3 months of inactivity.”

---

### **Step 2: Script the Demo**

Prepare a simple **3-part narrative**:

1. **Problem Statement:** “Businesses often struggle to understand customer churn. I built a no-code AI dashboard to predict churn risk.”
2. **Walkthrough:** “Here’s the dataset I uploaded, here are the key charts, and here’s the AI model predicting churn.”
3. **Outcome:** “Now, a manager can instantly see which customers are at high risk and take proactive steps.”

Keep it **2–3 minutes max** — short enough to keep attention, long enough to show depth.

---

### **Step 3: Record the Walkthrough**

* Use **Loom, OBS, or QuickTime**.
* Screen record while you:

  * Show dataset upload (even if just quickly).
  * Click through 2–3 dashboard sections.
  * Highlight one “wow” insight.
* Optional: Turn on your webcam bubble (Loom does this well) to add a human touch.

💡 **Tip:** Speak slowly and clearly, as if explaining to a non-technical client.

---

### **Step 4: Add Branding**

* If you can, add a **title slide** (“Customer Insights AI Dashboard – Built in Akkio”).
* Use a simple intro sentence at the start: “This is part of my 100 Days of AI journey.”
* Add your **name + contact** at the end of the video (text overlay).

---

### **Step 5: Publish & Share**

* Save the video as `.mp4` or keep Loom’s share link.
* Upload to YouTube (unlisted if you want private portfolio).
* Add it to your portfolio site under **Projects → AI Dashboards**.
* Share on LinkedIn with context:

  * “Day 68 of #100DaysOfAI: Built an AI dashboard that predicts churn risk. Here’s a quick demo.”

---

### ✅ **Outcome for Day 68**

* A polished **demo video (2–3 min)** showing your AI dashboard.
* Clear story: Problem → Dashboard → Insights → Business Value.
* Portfolio-ready link you can share with recruiters, clients, or on social.

Would you like me to also **write the sample 2-minute narration script** you can literally read while recording this demo? That way you don’t have to think about what to say while screen sharing.
