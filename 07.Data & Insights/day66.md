Got it — let’s dive deep into **Day 66: Import live data from Google Sheets**. By this point, you’ve already experimented with static datasets in **Akkio** or **ObviouslyAI**, but Day 66 is about making your AI models dynamic by feeding them **live, updating data**. This is where dashboards stop being “toy projects” and start becoming **business tools**.

# **Day 66 — Lessons & Exercises: Connecting AI to Google Sheets**

### **Lesson 1: Why Live Data Matters**

* Static CSVs are fine for experiments, but businesses operate on data that changes daily (sales, leads, customer feedback, inventory).
* Connecting Google Sheets means you can **auto-refresh models** and insights without manual uploads.
* It bridges the gap between **business teams (who love spreadsheets)** and **AI systems**.

---

### **Lesson 2: Setting Up the Connection**

* Log into **Akkio** (or ObviouslyAI, both support Google Sheets).
* Go to **“New Dataset” → Connect Data Source → Google Sheets**.
* Authenticate with your Google account.
* Pick a sheet with structured columns (e.g., Date, Customer ID, Region, Revenue, Feedback).
* Ensure the first row has clean headers — AI tools are picky about this.

---

### **Lesson 3: Choosing a Use Case**

Some simple but powerful business cases for live data feeds:

* **Sales Forecasting:** Daily revenue updates feed into predictive sales models.
* **Churn Prediction:** Track customer data and get daily risk scoring.
* **Marketing ROI:** Automatically analyze campaign spend vs. conversions.
* **Sentiment Tracking:** Pull in live survey responses or customer reviews.

---

### **Lesson 4: Auto-Refresh & Dashboards**

* Enable **auto-refresh** inside Akkio so your model retrains or updates as the sheet updates.
* Build a simple **dashboard**:

  * Graph of daily sales forecast
  * Table of “Top 10 churn risk customers”
  * Sentiment trend line from reviews
* Set it to refresh daily or weekly.

---

## **Exercises for Day 66**

### **Exercise 1: Connect Your First Sheet**

* Create a **sample Google Sheet** with 50–100 rows (e.g., “Sales Data” with Date, Product, Units Sold, Revenue).
* Connect it to Akkio.
* Verify that updates in the sheet reflect in the dashboard after refresh.

---

### **Exercise 2: Build a Predictive Model**

* Use your sheet to train a simple model:

  * Input: Date, Product, Region
  * Output: Revenue prediction
* Add 3 new rows in Google Sheets → watch the predictions update in real-time.

---

### **Exercise 3: Create a “Mini Business Command Center”**

* Add at least 3 visualizations to your dashboard:

  * A line chart (forecast trend)
  * A bar chart (top products by revenue)
  * A table (predicted churn customers or anomalies)
* Share dashboard link with a friend/colleague and ask for feedback.

---

### **Exercise 4: Add Real Data**

* Bonus challenge: Pull in a real dataset —

  * Export last month’s expenses, or
  * Use a public dataset (Kaggle, Google Trends, or a free marketing dataset).
* Connect it live and set it to auto-refresh.

---

### **Exercise 5: Record & Document**

* Record a short Loom walkthrough:

  * Start with the Google Sheet
  * Show how you connected it
  * Demonstrate live update in dashboard
* Add screenshots + 3-sentence summary to your portfolio.

---

✅ **Outcome for Day 66**

* You’ll have a working **AI dashboard connected to Google Sheets**.
* Your models will **auto-update with fresh data**.
* You’ll have your first **dynamic case study** that looks client-ready.

Would you like me to also **design Day 67** in the same expanded way (customer segmentation project), so it feels like a natural continuation of this “live data” milestone?
