Got it — let’s break down **Day 62** into a full lesson plan. This is your first hands-on step into **no-code predictive modeling** using **Akkio**. By the end of this day, you’ll build, train, and test your first AI model without writing a single line of code.

## **Day 62 — Lesson Expansion: Build Your First Predictive Model in Akkio**

### **Goal**

Learn how to take a dataset, feed it into Akkio, train a predictive model, and interpret the results. Your outcome will be a **working model** that can forecast or classify something useful, like sales, customer churn, or email responses.

---

### **Step 1: Understand What Predictive Modeling Means**

Before jumping into Akkio, clarify the concept:

* **Predictive modeling** uses historical data to **predict future outcomes**.
* Examples:

  * Will a customer **buy or not buy**?
  * What will next month’s **sales numbers** be?
  * Is this email **spam or not spam**?

Akkio automates this by handling the heavy ML work in the background, so you just choose a dataset and a target column.

---

### **Step 2: Prepare Your Dataset**

* Start with a **sample dataset**:

  * Download from Akkio’s built-in examples (like sales leads or marketing campaigns).
  * Or use a dataset you already have (CSV/Excel/Google Sheets).
* Example beginner dataset:

  * Columns: `Customer ID, Age, Location, Past Purchases, Email Opened, Clicked Ad`
  * Target column: `Clicked Ad` (Yes/No).

👉 If you don’t have data, pick one from **Kaggle** or Akkio’s sample sales dataset.

---

### **Step 3: Upload to Akkio**

1. Sign in to **Akkio**.
2. Upload your dataset (CSV, Excel, or connect Google Sheets).
3. Choose your **target variable** (the thing you want to predict).

   * Example: Predict “Clicked Ad = Yes/No”.

---

### **Step 4: Train Your Model**

* Click **Predict** in Akkio.
* The platform automatically splits your data into **training & testing sets**.
* It runs multiple algorithms in the background (you don’t need to code or choose).
* After a few seconds, you’ll see your **accuracy score**.

👉 Example: “Your model predicts customer clicks with **87% accuracy**.”

---

### **Step 5: Interpret the Results**

* Akkio shows you **Feature Importance** (which inputs matter most).

  * Example: “Age = 35–45 contributes 40% to prediction accuracy.”
* Study what’s driving the predictions.
* Think: Does this make business sense? (e.g., location or past purchases might matter more than gender).

---

### **Step 6: Test Your Model**

* Use **live prediction mode**: enter new data and see if the model predicts correctly.
* Example: Enter `Age=42, Location=NY, Past Purchases=3, Opened Email=Yes → Clicked Ad=Yes`.
* Validate with 5–10 test examples.

---

### **Step 7: Deploy or Share**

* Akkio lets you:

  * **Deploy as an API** → connect predictions to a live app.
  * **Share as a web app** → anyone can input data and see predictions.
* For Day 62: just **share the web app link** (nice to include in your portfolio).

---

### **Step 8: Document Your Learning**

* Take screenshots:

  * Dataset upload
  * Accuracy score
  * Feature importance chart
  * Sample prediction
* Save them in your portfolio folder.
* Write a 3–5 line case study:

  > “Built a no-code AI model in Akkio to predict ad clicks with 87% accuracy. The model identified age and past purchase behavior as the strongest predictors. Deployed a shareable app for testing live predictions.”

---

✅ **Outcome for Day 62**

* You’ve trained your first no-code predictive model.
* You understand target variables, accuracy scores, and feature importance.
* You have a live model or web app link you can showcase.
* You’ve started your **AI data portfolio**.

Would you like me to also expand **Day 63** (using **ObviouslyAI** for comparison) so you can see how two no-code ML tools differ — almost like doing the same project twice with different platforms?
