Great choice. Day 64 is where you start **building your own no-code classification model** (think: “will this customer churn or stay?”, “is this review positive or negative?”, “is this lead hot or cold?”). Let’s expand it into a full **lesson + exercises** format, so you can actually practice and end the day with a working project.

# **Day 64 — Lesson Expansion: Build a Classification Model (No-Code)**

### **Goal**

By the end of the day, you will have created and tested a **classification AI model** using a no-code platform (Akkio, ObviouslyAI, or Peltarion). You’ll also interpret results and export insights to share in your portfolio.

---

## **Part 1: Learn the Concept (Theory in 15 minutes)**

* **Classification models** answer: *“Which category does this input belong to?”*
* Examples:

  * Spam vs Not Spam (binary classification)
  * Churn vs Active (binary classification)
  * Sentiment: Positive, Neutral, Negative (multi-class classification)
* **Key concepts:**

  * *Features*: Inputs (age, purchase frequency, text review).
  * *Labels*: Output category (churn = yes/no).
  * *Training*: Teaching AI using labeled data.
  * *Accuracy & F1 Score*: How well the model performs.

---

## **Part 2: Build Your Model (Hands-on)**

1. **Pick your platform**:

   * [Akkio](https://akkio.com) → drag-and-drop, business-friendly.
   * [ObviouslyAI](https://obviously.ai) → super fast for classification.

2. **Upload a dataset** (they provide sample data, or you can use Kaggle datasets).

   * Example dataset: *Customer churn* with features like age, subscription length, last login, purchase frequency.

3. **Select target column**:

   * For churn dataset, the column = `Churned? (Yes/No)`.

4. **Train the model** (one click).

   * The platform automatically selects algorithms and optimizes.

5. **Review performance metrics**:

   * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.
   * Example: 82% accuracy means model predicts correctly 8/10 times.

---

## **Part 3: Test the Model**

* Use the **prediction tool** to enter hypothetical customer data.

* Example:

  * Customer A: 28 years, logged in daily, purchased monthly → model predicts *Active*.
  * Customer B: 50 years, no login in 60 days, no purchase → model predicts *Churn*.

* Check if predictions make sense. If not, adjust features.

---

## **Part 4: Interpret & Present Insights**

* Platforms like Akkio auto-generate **feature importance** (which inputs matter most).

* Example:

  * “Last login date is the #1 factor predicting churn.”
  * “Customers under 30 are 2x less likely to churn.”

* Export insights to PDF or screenshot the dashboard.

---

## **Exercises for Day 64**

**Exercise 1: Binary Classification**

* Dataset: Customer churn.
* Task: Train a churn vs no-churn model.
* Deliverable: Share top 3 factors that cause churn.

**Exercise 2: Multi-Class Classification**

* Dataset: Customer support tickets.
* Task: Classify tickets into *Billing, Technical, General Inquiry*.
* Deliverable: Export a confusion matrix and note accuracy.

**Exercise 3: Sentiment Analysis**

* Dataset: Product reviews.
* Task: Classify reviews into *Positive, Neutral, Negative*.
* Deliverable: Run predictions on 3 new reviews you write yourself.

**Exercise 4: Portfolio Case Study**

* Document your process: dataset → target → results → insights.
* Create a 1-page PDF or Notion write-up: *“AI Model that predicts customer churn with 82% accuracy”*.
* Add screenshots of model dashboard + insights.

---

## **Outcome of Day 64**

* You understand classification models.
* You’ve built and tested at least one binary and one multi-class model.
* You have a documented case study for your **portfolio** (huge credibility boost).

Want me to expand **Day 65** next (AI dashboards + auto-insights), in the same detailed lesson + exercise format? That would naturally build on your Day 64 classification project.
