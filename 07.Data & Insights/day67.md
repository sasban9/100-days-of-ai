Got it — let’s go **deep on Day 67**, which is all about **customer segmentation** using no-code AI. This is where you start building something *business-critical* that companies actually pay consultants for.

# **Day 67 — Lesson Expansion: Customer Segmentation with No-Code AI**

### **Goal**

By the end of the day, you’ll have an **AI-powered segmentation model** that groups customers (or users) into clusters based on their behavior, preferences, or attributes — without writing a single line of code. You’ll also learn how to **visualize and interpret** these segments so you can present them as business insights.

---

## **Step 1: Gather Your Dataset**

* Use a **sample dataset** if you don’t have real data. Many AI tools (like Akkio, ObviouslyAI) provide demo datasets.
* A good dataset includes:

  * Customer ID
  * Demographics (age, gender, location, income, etc.)
  * Behavior (purchase frequency, product categories, website visits, churn status, etc.)
  * Engagement (email opens, support tickets, app usage time, etc.)

👉 If you don’t have one, download the **“E-Commerce Customer Data”** sample (commonly available on Kaggle/Google).

---

## **Step 2: Choose a No-Code AI Tool**

Recommended tools:

* **Akkio** → fast, intuitive, with auto-visualizations.
* **ObviouslyAI** → simple predictions + clustering.
* **Google BigQuery ML (with a no-code UI)** if you want enterprise scale.

---

## **Step 3: Upload and Explore**

* Upload dataset → let the tool run its **exploratory analysis**.
* Check for missing values → some tools can auto-clean.
* Look at **correlations** (e.g., “income strongly correlates with spending score”).

---

## **Step 4: Build a Segmentation Model**

* Use **Clustering (K-means or similar)**. Most no-code platforms let you choose “Clustering” from a dropdown.
* Define how many clusters you want (start with 3–5).

  * Example:

    * Segment 1: “High spenders, loyal”
    * Segment 2: “Price-sensitive, occasional”
    * Segment 3: “At risk of churn”
* Run the model → wait for tool to group customers.

---

## **Step 5: Interpret the Segments**

* Look at segment profiles:

  * Segment A: “Young, high app usage, low spending → Potential upsell group”
  * Segment B: “Older, low engagement, high spending → VIP group”
  * Segment C: “Medium spend, inconsistent visits → Nurture with offers”
* The key is turning raw data → **actionable insight**.

---

## **Step 6: Visualize**

* Use built-in dashboards (Akkio auto-creates segment charts).
* Create 2–3 visuals:

  * Pie chart: % of customers per segment.
  * Scatter plot: spending vs visits by segment.
  * Bar chart: churn risk by segment.
* Export them → they’ll make your case study portfolio-ready.

---

## **Step 7: Business Application**

* Think of how a company would use these segments:

  * Marketing → personalized campaigns (“Segment A gets discounts, Segment B gets loyalty rewards”).
  * Product → identify which features VIPs use most.
  * Sales → target upsells to mid-segment customers.
* Write 2–3 sentences on **business impact**. Example:

  > “By identifying that 22% of customers are ‘loyal high spenders,’ we recommended a VIP membership plan. For the 18% who are ‘at-risk churners,’ we suggested retention offers. This segmentation can improve revenue by 10–15%.”

---

## **Step 8: Portfolio Output**

* Deliverables for today:

  * Segmentation model screenshot (clusters visible).
  * 2–3 charts that explain the segments.
  * A short **“business insight note”** (like a mini-consulting report).
* Save all in your portfolio folder under **AI Data Projects**.

---

✅ **Outcome for Day 67**

* You have built and tested a **customer segmentation AI model** in a no-code tool.
* You can explain segments in business language (not just technical).
* You have **visuals + insights** ready for your portfolio.
* You’re one step closer to selling this as a service to businesses.

Would you like me to take Day 67 a step further and design a **sample case study write-up** (like a polished consulting deliverable) that you can drop straight into your portfolio?
