Great choice — Day 65 is all about **auto-insight dashboards in Akkio**, which is where no-code AI starts looking like real business intelligence work. Let’s turn this day into a **mini project** with clear lessons and hands-on exercises.

## **Day 65 — Lesson Expansion: Auto-Insights Dashboards with Akkio**

### **Goal**

By the end of the day, you’ll have created a **live AI-powered dashboard** in Akkio that automatically discovers trends, patterns, and anomalies in your data, then presents them in a business-friendly format.

---

### **Lesson 1: What Are Auto-Insights Dashboards?**

* Auto-insights are AI-driven analyses that detect important patterns without manual pivoting or deep statistical work.
* In Akkio, once you upload data (like sales, customer churn, marketing campaigns), the system will:

  * Highlight key drivers of outcomes
  * Spot anomalies (sudden spikes or drops)
  * Visualize correlations automatically
  * Suggest predictive signals you might miss manually

**Takeaway:** These dashboards save hours of manual data crunching and make insights accessible to non-technical users.

---

### **Lesson 2: Setting Up the Dashboard**

1. **Log in to Akkio** → Open the “Insights” tab.
2. **Upload a dataset** (could be sample data from Akkio, Kaggle, or your own business data).

   * Example: Sales data, marketing campaign results, or customer demographics.
3. Once data loads, click **Auto-Insights** → Akkio generates charts and patterns automatically.

---

### **Lesson 3: Exploring Insights**

* Learn to read what Akkio highlights:

  * **Top drivers**: Which features most affect your outcome (e.g., “Discount % drives sales strongly”).
  * **Anomalies**: Unusual spikes or drops (“Revenue dropped sharply on weekends”).
  * **Segments**: Subgroups in your data that behave differently (“Customers aged 25–35 respond best to email campaigns”).
* Tip: Toggle different views (correlations, importance, trends) to see how AI thinks.

---

### **Lesson 4: Turning Insights into a Dashboard**

* Pin the most useful insights into a **dashboard view**.
* Customize it by:

  * Renaming widgets (“Sales Drivers” instead of “Variable Importance”).
  * Adding multiple datasets if needed.
  * Choosing the most business-relevant KPIs.
* Share dashboard → create a **public or team link** for easy access.

---

### **Exercises**

1. **Beginner Exercise:** Upload Akkio’s sample *E-commerce sales dataset*. Generate auto-insights. Identify the **top 3 drivers of sales**.
2. **Intermediate Exercise:** Pin 5 different insights into a custom dashboard. Save and name it “Sales Driver Dashboard.”
3. **Advanced Exercise:**

   * Upload your own dataset (from work, side project, or open data).
   * Create an auto-insight dashboard.
   * Write a 200-word summary of the most surprising finding.
   * Example: “We discovered that customers who order at night spend 30% more per transaction.”

---

### **Lesson 5: Business Application**

* Share the dashboard with a hypothetical client or manager. Frame it as:

  * “Here’s a live dashboard that updates automatically and surfaces trends in real time.”
* Think of **3 use cases**:

  1. Marketing: Which campaigns convert best.
  2. Sales: Which regions or discounts drive revenue.
  3. HR: Which employee factors predict retention.

---

### **Deliverables for Day 65**

* At least **one working AI dashboard** in Akkio.
* A **short write-up** of your top 3 insights.
* A **shared link or screenshot** to showcase in your portfolio.

---

👉 By the end of Day 65, you don’t just know how to use Akkio — you can demonstrate to clients how AI dashboards uncover hidden patterns in their data, which is a big value-add for consultants, freelancers, or agencies.

Do you want me to expand **Day 66** next (live data from Google Sheets → real-time dashboard), since it’s the natural continuation of this?
