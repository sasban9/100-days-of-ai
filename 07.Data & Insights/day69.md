Got it — let’s go deep into **Day 69**. This is when you **turn your AI dashboard into a polished portfolio case study**. By this point, you’ve already built the dashboard (in Akkio, ObviouslyAI, or another no-code tool), so today is about **storytelling, polish, and presentation** — making your work look like something a client or employer would pay for.

# **Day 69 — Expanded Lesson: Case Study Creation for AI Dashboard**

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

Transform your AI dashboard project into a **professional case study** with screenshots, explanations, and impact examples. By the end of the day, you’ll have a **sharable, client-ready portfolio piece**.

---

### **Step 1: Review Your Dashboard**

* Open your dashboard and check:

  * Does the **data load correctly** (Google Sheets, CSV, or live data)?
  * Are the **charts and visuals clear** (no clutter, right labeling)?
  * Does the **AI model produce insights** that make sense (forecasts, classifications, predictions)?
* Fix formatting: clean titles, matching color schemes, no “test/test123” labels.

Example:

* Dataset: Retail sales by month.
* Dashboard: AI predicts next 3 months’ sales, highlights top regions, and suggests marketing spend allocation.

---

### **Step 2: Capture Screenshots & Video**

* Take **3–4 screenshots**:

  1. The full dashboard view.
  2. A close-up of an AI-generated insight.
  3. An example chart (forecast, segmentation, etc.).
  4. Input screen (upload data, select prediction type).

* Record a **30–60 sec demo video** walking through:

  * “Here’s my dataset…”
  * “Here’s how the AI model predicts outcomes…”
  * “Here’s how the dashboard helps make better decisions…”

---

### **Step 3: Write Your Case Study**

Structure it simply — like a mini client project.

1. **Problem**

   * What was the challenge? (e.g., “Businesses struggle to predict sales trends and understand customer behavior without data teams.”)

2. **Solution**

   * What you built (e.g., “I created an AI-powered dashboard in Akkio that forecasts sales, identifies customer churn, and generates insights automatically from spreadsheets.”)

3. **Process**

   * Tools used (Akkio, Google Sheets, etc.).
   * AI model type (forecasting, classification, clustering).
   * Workflow (“Upload → Train Model → Auto Dashboard → Insights”).

4. **Results**

   * Example insights produced.
   * Visuals of forecast chart, churn prediction, etc.
   * A note on business value (“This could help managers reduce churn by 15% or reallocate budget for better ROI.”).

5. **Next Steps**

   * How this dashboard could be extended for real clients (connect to live databases, Slack alerts, custom reports).

---

### **Step 4: Add to Portfolio**

* Create a dedicated page on your site (Webflow, Carrd, Notion).
* Title: **AI Dashboard for Business Insights (Case Study)**
* Add screenshots, case study text, and embedded demo video.
* End with a **CTA** (“Want a dashboard like this for your business? Contact me here.”).

---

### **Step 5: Share Publicly**

* Write a LinkedIn or Twitter post:

  * Hook: “Most businesses sit on data but don’t use it. I built a no-code AI dashboard that turns raw data into insights in minutes.”
  * Add 1 screenshot.
  * Link to full case study or demo video.

---

### **Pro Tips**

* Keep visuals **simple and client-friendly** — avoid heavy jargon.
* Use a real dataset (Kaggle, open data, or anonymized real business data) so it feels authentic.
* Position your case study as a **business solution**, not just a technical demo. Clients care about outcomes.

---

✅ **Outcome for Day 69**

* A polished **case study page** on your portfolio.
* Demo video and screenshots ready for social sharing.
* A public post showing your AI dashboard work.
* You now look like someone who can **deliver real business insights** with AI, not just build toy projects.
