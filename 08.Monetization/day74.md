Great — let’s zoom in on **Day 74**. By this point, you’ve got hands-on AI experience with prompts, automations, chatbots, dashboards, and workflows. Day 74 is where you shift gears from “learning” to **packaging your skills into a business pitch**. Think of this as preparing your *first offer* to a client in a niche market.

# **Day 74 — Build Your First AI Pitch Deck**

### 🎯 **Goal**

By the end of the day, you’ll have a **short, clear, and client-ready AI pitch deck** (8–10 slides) that communicates:

* What problem you solve
* How AI helps
* Why you are the right person to deliver it
* What it costs

This is not a fancy investor deck — it’s a **sales tool** you can send to a business owner, decision-maker, or prospective client.

---

### **Step 1: Pick Your Niche**

* Choose 1 industry to focus on (from Day 71’s decision: e.g., **real estate, coaching, healthcare, education, retail, restaurants**).
* Keep it narrow for maximum impact — e.g., instead of “education,” choose “online course creators.”

*Example:* “AI Solutions for Real Estate Agents.”

---

### **Step 2: Define the Problem**

* Research the **top 3–5 pain points** in your chosen niche.
* Example (Real Estate):

  1. Too much time wasted on repetitive client Q\&A
  2. Difficulty creating consistent property listings/ads
  3. Struggle to track leads and follow up

Write these clearly in your deck — pain points are what make clients listen.

---

### **Step 3: Match AI Solutions**

For each problem, map a no-code AI solution you can provide.

* **Problem 1:** Repetitive client questions → **AI Chatbot** for instant replies
* **Problem 2:** Inconsistent property ads → **AI Copywriter App** that generates listings automatically
* **Problem 3:** Poor follow-up → **AI Workflow Automation** (Zapier + CRM reminders)

---

### **Step 4: Structure Your Deck**

Keep it simple — 1 idea per slide. Suggested outline:

1. **Title Slide** → Your name + “AI Solutions for \[Niche]”
2. **Industry Challenges** → 3 main pain points
3. **Your AI Solution** → Overview of how AI addresses these problems
4. **Solution #1** (Chatbot) → Demo screenshot or mockup
5. **Solution #2** (Automation/App) → Simple flow diagram
6. **Solution #3** (Dashboard/Insights) → Example screenshot
7. **Benefits** → Time saved, cost reduced, revenue increased
8. **Pricing Options** → 2–3 clear packages
9. **Next Steps** → How to start (free consultation, pilot project, trial)
10. **Contact Info** → Email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn

---

### **Step 5: Create Visuals**

* Use **Canva** or **Pitch.com** to design clean, modern slides.
* Screenshots of your projects (from Day 30, 40, 50, 60, 70) make it real.
* If you don’t have real client data yet, **mock up a realistic example**.

---

### **Step 6: Add Pricing Packages**

Keep it simple with 2–3 tiers:

* Starter (₹10k–₹20k): 1 chatbot or 1 automation
* Pro (₹30k–₹50k): chatbot + automation + content tool
* Premium (₹60k+): full workflow with dashboard + training

💡 Tip: Frame it around **business outcomes** (“Save 20+ hours per month” or “Generate 2x more leads”), not just “I’ll build you a chatbot.”

---

### **Step 7: Practice Your Pitch**

* Record a **3-minute Loom video** walking through your slides.
* Imagine you’re speaking to a business owner, not a techie.
* Keep the language simple: “This saves you time and makes you money.”

---

### ✅ **Outcome for Day 74**

* A polished **AI Pitch Deck** (8–10 slides)
* A **recorded Loom walkthrough**
* Clarity on your **first real offer** to businesses
* Ready-to-send material to prospects on Day 75

Would you like me to **create a slide-by-slide sample pitch deck** (text + suggested visuals) for one specific niche, say *real estate agents* or *coaches*? That way, you’ll have a concrete template to follow.
