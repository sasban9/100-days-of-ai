Got it — let’s go deep into **Day 75** because this is one of the first **real-world business building days** in the 100-day roadmap. Up to this point, you’ve been learning, building, and documenting. Now you switch gears into **outreach and client-facing action**.

# **Day 75 — Outreach with Free AI Audits**

### 🎯 **Goal**

By the end of today, you will have:

1. A clear **offer** (a free AI audit).
2. A **short outreach message** template.
3. A target list of **5 businesses or professionals** to contact.
4. Your first messages sent out.

---

### **Step 1: Define Your Free AI Audit**

An AI audit is a low-barrier entry point — businesses love “free value first.” Keep it specific and useful:

* **What you’ll deliver in 30 minutes of work:**

  * Identify 2–3 areas where AI could save them time or money.
  * Suggest 1 automation or chatbot they could try immediately.
  * Share 1 concrete example (like “auto-summarizing client emails” or “auto-generating blog drafts”).

* **How you’ll deliver it:**

  * A one-page PDF report, or
  * A short Loom video walkthrough (even better — feels personal).

---

### **Step 2: Pick Your Target Businesses**

Choose 5 small to mid-size businesses where AI can make an immediate difference. Ideal targets:

* Real estate agencies
* Coaches/consultants
* Digital marketing agencies
* Restaurants & cafes
* Online stores (Shopify, WooCommerce)
* Healthcare clinics

Pro tip: Start with **people you already know** (friends, family, LinkedIn connections, local contacts). Warm outreach gets better responses than cold DMs.

---

### **Step 3: Write Your Outreach Template**

Keep it short, direct, and value-driven. Example (LinkedIn/Email/WhatsApp):

> Hi \[Name],
> I’ve been building AI-powered tools and noticed that many \[industry] businesses are leaving efficiency gains on the table. I’d love to offer you a quick **free AI audit** — basically a 1-page report or 5-minute Loom video showing 2–3 ways you could automate tasks, cut costs, or attract more customers using AI.
>
> No strings attached — if it’s useful, great; if not, at least you’ll get some ideas. Would you like me to send one over?

---

### **Step 4: Send to 5 Businesses**

* Send via LinkedIn DMs, email, or WhatsApp (depending on your relationship).
* Log who you contacted + date in a spreadsheet.
* Be consistent: if no reply in 3–4 days, send a polite follow-up.

---

### **Step 5: Prepare Your Audit Framework**

While waiting for responses, draft your audit template. Keep it structured:

**Example: “AI Audit for \[Business Name]”**

1. **Observation:** Current workflow (manual customer emails, social media posting, etc.)
2. **AI Opportunity #1:** \[Tool + outcome + time saved]
3. **AI Opportunity #2:** \[Tool + outcome + money saved]
4. **Quick Win:** Something they can try in <1 day.

Format: Google Doc or Canva PDF.

---

### **Step 6: Mindset Shift**

Remember: today is **not about selling**. It’s about planting seeds. Even if only **1 out of 5 responds**, that’s a win — and it might lead to your **first paying client** in Days 76–80.

---

✅ **Outcome for Day 75**

* 5 businesses contacted with a clear free value offer.
* A ready-to-use audit framework/template.
* A small but real start to your **AI consulting pipeline**.

Would you like me to also **expand Day 76**, showing exactly how to turn one of these free audits into your **first paying client** (with scripts + pricing)?
