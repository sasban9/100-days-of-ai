## **Day 71 — Lesson Expansion: Choosing Your Monetization Path**

### **Goal**

By the end of today, you will have chosen your **primary monetization track** (Freelancing, Product, or Agency) and outlined a **90-day monetization plan**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the 3 Main Tracks**

1. **Freelancing Track**

   * You sell your skills directly.
   * Services: prompt engineering, building chatbots, workflow automations, AI dashboards, content generation.
   * Platforms: Upwork, Fiverr, Contra, LinkedIn.
   * Fastest way to earn money (can close deals in 1–2 weeks).

2. **Product Track**

   * You build **AI-powered digital products** (templates, apps, tools).
   * Examples: Gumroad templates, Notion AI dashboards, Glide AI apps, Bubble SaaS.
   * Revenue model: one-time sales or subscriptions.
   * Slower start but scalable (income grows while you sleep).

3. **Agency/Consulting Track**

   * You help businesses adopt AI at scale.
   * Services: AI audits, workflow automation, chatbots, dashboards, training.
   * Higher ticket size (₹50k–₹5L per client).
   * Requires credibility (portfolio, case studies, testimonials).

---

### **Step 2: Self-Assessment Exercise**

* Ask yourself:

  * Do I want **fast income**? → Start with Freelancing.
  * Do I want **passive income**? → Build Products.
  * Do I want **big income**? → Build an Agency/Consulting practice.
* Time commitment:

  * Freelancing = solo, low barrier.
  * Product = build once, market forever.
  * Agency = hire/scale, more effort.

---

### **Step 3: Research Market Demand**

* Browse **Upwork, Fiverr, LinkedIn Jobs** for “AI automation,” “AI chatbot,” “AI consultant.”
* Note 5 recurring problems clients want solved.
* Write them in your notebook.
* Example:

  * “Summarize long reports into 1-pagers”
  * “Automate social media posts”
  * “Build a custom chatbot for my website”

---

### **Step 4: Pick Your Track**

* Make the decision today — don’t stay stuck.
* Write:

  * “For the next 90 days, I will focus on \[Freelancing / Product / Agency].”
* Add why you chose it (so you stay motivated).

---

### **Step 5: Define Your First Offer**

* Draft a **clear value proposition** in 1 sentence:

  * Freelancing: “I help small businesses automate their customer support using AI chatbots.”
  * Product: “I create Notion AI templates for professionals who want to save time.”
  * Agency: “We help real estate companies adopt AI to improve lead conversion.”

---

### **Step 6: 90-Day Monetization Roadmap (Macro Plan)**

* **Month 1 (Days 71–100):** Launch → Build first portfolio offers.
* **Month 2:** Acquire 3–5 paying clients OR 50 product sales.
* **Month 3:** Scale pricing, packages, testimonials, and recurring income.

### **Step 7: Today’s Action Deliverables**

1. Choose **your monetization path**.
2. Write down your **first offer statement**.
3. Create a **Notion/Google Doc** titled: “AI Monetization Roadmap.”
