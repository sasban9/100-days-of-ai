Got it — let’s go deep into **Day 73: Build Pricing Packages (₹10k–₹50k projects)**.
This is where you stop being just a learner and start **positioning yourself as a service provider**. The aim is to turn your AI skills (apps, chatbots, dashboards, automations) into **clear, sellable offers** with structured pricing tiers that business owners can understand.

# **Day 73 — Lesson Expansion: Pricing Packages**

### **🎯 Goal**

By the end of today, you will have **3 pricing tiers (Starter, Growth, Premium)** for your AI services, each with clear deliverables and a price range (₹10k–₹50k). These packages should look professional enough to pitch to a small business client tomorrow.

---

## **Step 1: Define Your Core Service Types**

Think about what you’ve built in earlier weeks. Most no-code AI services fit into these categories:

1. **AI Chatbots** (customer support, FAQ bots, lead qualification).
2. **Workflow Automations** (email summaries, lead routing, content repurposing).
3. **No-Code AI Apps** (idea generators, report creators, calculators).
4. **AI Dashboards** (sales forecasting, customer insights, trend analysis).

👉 You don’t need all 4 in each package. Pick **1–2 core services** you’re strongest at delivering.

---

## **Step 2: Design Your Pricing Ladder**

Clients need **simple, clear options**. Three tiers usually work best:

**Starter (₹10k–₹15k)**

* 1 simple chatbot (FAQ or lead capture) **OR** 1 automation workflow.
* Basic branding (colors, logo integration).
* 1-hour handover call with instructions.
* Delivery: 1 week.

**Growth (₹25k–₹30k)**

* Everything in Starter.
* * 1 additional service (automation OR dashboard).
* * chatbot trained on client’s website content or docs.
* 1 month of light support (bug fixes, Q\&A).
* Delivery: 2–3 weeks.

**Premium (₹45k–₹50k)**

* Everything in Growth.
* * multi-agent workflow tailored to business.
* * AI dashboard (sales forecast, customer insights).
* * content generator (blogs, social posts, ads).
* 1 month full support + training for staff.
* Delivery: 4 weeks.

---

## **Step 3: Show Tangible Business Outcomes**

Pricing is easier to justify when tied to outcomes. Frame deliverables like this:

* “Your customer support costs drop by 20% with an AI FAQ bot.”
* “Weekly sales reports will take 10 minutes instead of 10 hours.”
* “AI-generated social posts save you 15+ hours/month.”

---

## **Step 4: Package Presentation**

Create a **one-pager** in Notion, Canva, or Google Docs with:

* Title: “AI Solutions Packages”
* 3-column layout (Starter, Growth, Premium).
* Bullet-point deliverables.
* Price clearly visible at the bottom.
* Optional: add a “Most Popular” badge on Growth.

---

## **Step 5: Validation & Feedback**

* Share draft packages with 2–3 trusted friends/mentors.
* Ask: “Would you, as a business owner, understand and feel confident buying one of these packages?”
* Adjust based on feedback (maybe add/remove features or adjust pricing).

---

## **Step 6: Finalize for Portfolio**

* Add packages to your **portfolio site** under “Services.”
* Record a **2-minute Loom video** where you walk through the packages in plain English.
* Save a **PDF version** of your packages for client outreach.

---

### ✅ **Outcome for Day 73**

* A **clear, professional pricing ladder** (Starter, Growth, Premium).
* 1 polished one-pager + PDF you can send to prospects.
* 1 Loom video you can embed in your portfolio.
* Confidence to say, “My services start at ₹10k and go up to ₹50k depending on the package.”

Would you like me to **design sample one-pager layouts** (like how the packages should visually look in Canva/Notion) so you can use them directly for your portfolio?
