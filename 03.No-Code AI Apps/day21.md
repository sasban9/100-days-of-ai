Great — let’s zoom into **Day 21: Sign up for Bubble & Glide. Explore templates.**

Here’s how you can approach it step by step so that by the end of the day you’ll not only have accounts ready but also a sense of what kind of apps you can build quickly with no-code AI platforms.

---

### **Morning (1–2 hours) – Account Setup & Orientation**

1. **Bubble**

   * Go to [bubble.io](https://bubble.io) → sign up with Google/Gmail.
   * Walk through the onboarding. Bubble will suggest some starter apps.
   * Open the **“To-Do List”** or **“CRM Starter”** template and click around to see how pages, workflows, and the database are structured.

2. **Glide**

   * Go to [glideapps.com](https://glideapps.com) → sign up with Google.
   * Start a new project. Choose **Google Sheets as data source**.
   * Select a simple Glide template (like **Task Tracker** or **Recipe Book**) and explore how it auto-builds an app from spreadsheet rows.

### **Afternoon (1–2 hours) – Template Exploration**

1. **In Bubble:**

   * Open the template editor. Look for:

     * **Design tab** → controls UI elements.
     * **Workflow tab** → controls actions triggered by buttons, inputs, etc.
     * **Data tab** → shows the database behind the app.
   * Make one small change (e.g., rename a button, add a text field, change page background).

2. **In Glide:**

   * Open your first app in editor.
   * Change the sheet values and watch how app updates instantly.
   * Explore **components** (lists, buttons, forms).
   * Add a new tab in your app, powered by a different sheet.

### **Evening (1–2 hours) – Inspiration & Notes**

* Browse the **Bubble Showcase Gallery** → see what people have built without coding.
* Browse **Glide Template Store** → look at CRM, booking apps, calculators, etc.
* Write down 3–5 app ideas you could realistically build with Bubble/Glide in the coming weeks (like: AI resume checker, personalized study planner, chatbot-integrated FAQ app).
* Save them in your “AI Project Journal.”
