Great choice — Day 25 is where you connect **Glide** with the **OpenAI API** to make your first **real AI-powered mobile-style app**. Let’s break it into a clear step-by-step playbook.

# 🔎 **Day 25: Add OpenAI API to Glide (AI Integration)**

### 🎯 Goal

Turn your Glide app from a static data app into an **AI-powered app** that can generate, summarize, or transform text/images on demand.

---

### 🛠️ Step 1 — Set Up Glide App

1. Log into **Glide** (glideapps.com).
2. Create a new project (choose “Mobile App” layout).
3. Pick a simple starting template (e.g., “Notes App” or “Knowledge Base”).
4. Open the **Data Editor** to see the spreadsheet-style backend.

---

### 🛠️ Step 2 — Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
2. Create a new **secret key**.
3. Copy it (keep it private).
4. You’ll use this key inside Glide → via the **API integration** feature.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3 — Create a Custom Action in Glide

1. In Glide, open **Settings → Integrations → OpenAI**.
2. Paste your **API key**.
3. Now, whenever you create a **Custom Action**, you’ll see OpenAI as an option.

---

### 🛠️ Step 4 — Build Your First AI Action

Example: **AI Idea Generator**

1. Add a **Text Entry Field** in your app → “Enter a topic”.
2. Create a **Button** → “Generate Ideas”.
3. Attach an **Action** → “Ask OpenAI”.
4. In the prompt field, type:

   ```
   Generate 5 creative business ideas about [Topic]
   ```

   (Glide automatically replaces \[Topic] with user input).
5. Save the response into a column called “AI Output”.

---

### 🛠️ Step 5 — Display the AI Output

1. Add a **Text Component** to show the **AI Output**.
2. Test it on your phone → enter “fitness” and tap the button.
3. You should see:

   * AI-generated business ideas displayed instantly.

---

### 🛠️ Step 6 — Enhance the App

Ideas for making it more advanced:

* Add **multi-choice prompts** (e.g., “Summarize / Translate / Expand”).
* Add **AI Image Generator** button (DALL·E integration).
* Save **history of all generations** for each user.
* Style it → clean UI, branding, emoji icons.

---

### 🛠️ Step 7 — Test & Share

* Invite 2–3 friends to try your app.
* Collect feedback: Was the AI fast enough? Was the UI clear?
* Post on LinkedIn/Twitter:
  *“Just added OpenAI integration to my Glide app — now it generates business ideas on the fly! 🚀”*

---

✅ By the end of Day 25, you’ll have your **first working AI-powered mobile app** live on Glide.
