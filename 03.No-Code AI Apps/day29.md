Great choice — **Day 29 (“Publish your app and get feedback from 2 friends”)** is a powerful step because it transforms your project from a private experiment into something people interact with. Let’s expand it into a mini action plan so you get the maximum value.

### 🔹 Expanded **Day 29: Publish Your AI App & Collect Feedback**

**1. Prepare Your App for Sharing**

* Make sure the app works on mobile and desktop (since many people will open on phone).
* Add a simple welcome screen: “Hi 👋, this app helps you \[X]. Try it out!”
* If using Bubble, deploy the live version. If using Glide, share the live link.
* Give the app a clear name (avoid generic names like “AI tool” — instead “QuickBlog Summarizer” or “IdeaSpark”).

**2. Choose 2–3 Test Users**

* Pick close friends, colleagues, or family who represent your *target audience* (e.g., if it’s a content app, ask a friend who writes).
* Message them personally: “Hey, I built a small AI app in 7 days. Can you try it for 5 minutes and tell me what works and what feels confusing?”

**3. Give Simple Instructions**

* Don’t overwhelm testers — give them 1–2 tasks like:

  * “Enter a blog link and see the summary.”
  * “Type a business idea and see what suggestions it gives.”
* This makes feedback more actionable.

**4. Collect Feedback Properly**

* Ask 3 short questions (Google Form or Notion table works great):

  1. What’s the most useful part?
  2. What’s confusing or frustrating?
  3. If this app disappeared tomorrow, would you care? Why/why not?

**5. Improve Before Going Public**

* Fix the top 1–2 issues users mention. Don’t try to fix everything at once.
* Add a “What’s next” note inside the app (users like seeing it’s evolving).

**6. Share Publicly (Optional but Recommended)**

* Post on LinkedIn/Twitter: “I just published my first AI app. It helps \[X]. Would love feedback if you try it 👉 \[link].”
* Add a screenshot + 1-liner description to grab attention.

By the end of Day 29, you won’t just have an app online — you’ll have *real user reactions*. This is the first step toward turning experiments into products people want.

Do you want me to also **design a simple feedback template** (Google Form or Notion-style) for you to send to testers so they give structured input instead of vague “it’s nice” replies?
