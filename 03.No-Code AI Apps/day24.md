Great choice. Let’s go deep into **Day 24: Try Glide – build a mobile-style app with AI search.**

Glide is one of the easiest ways to build **mobile-first apps** without code. By the end of this day, you should have a working app on your phone where users can search and get results enhanced with AI.

# 🔎 **Day 24 Expansion — Building an AI Search App in Glide**

### **Morning (1–2 hours) – Setup & Basics**

1. Sign up at [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/) with your Google account.
2. Choose a **starter template** (e.g., “Directory” or “Knowledge Base”).
3. Connect a **Google Sheet** as your data source.

   * Example: Create a Sheet with two columns:

     * **Topic** (e.g., “Marketing Strategy,” “AI Tools”)
     * **Description** (brief explanation).
4. Explore Glide’s layout editor → test how data looks inside the app.

### **Afternoon (2–3 hours) – Adding AI Search**

1. Enable **Glide AI features** (check if your plan supports it).
2. Add a **search bar** that queries the “Topic” and “Description” columns.
3. Use **AI text completion** to enhance results. For example:

   * User searches “How to grow on Instagram.”
   * AI takes matching row and generates an **improved tip** like:
     *“For Instagram growth, focus on Reels + collaborations. Try 3 posts/day.”*
4. Test the workflow with 5–10 queries.

---

### **Evening (1–2 hours) – Polish & Publish**

1. Add **branding**: logo, colors, name your app (“AI Knowledge Finder”).
2. Create a **welcome screen** explaining the app’s purpose.
3. Add one extra feature (optional):

   * **Favorites** list → users save top answers.
   * **Categories** → filter by topic.
   * **Share** → let users share results.
4. Publish your Glide app. You’ll get a sharable link like `yourapp.glide.page`.
5. Test on your own phone — Glide apps open like native apps.

---

### **Deliverable for Day 24**

* A fully working Glide app with AI-powered search.
* App published and accessible via a link.
* Screenshots or screen-recording of app in action.

👉 Pro tip: Keep this app **simple**. The goal is to learn Glide + AI integration, not build a polished product yet. Later in Days 28–30, you’ll refine it into something demo-worthy.
