Great choice — **Day 30 is a milestone** because it’s the first time you showcase something tangible you’ve built with AI to the outside world. Let’s expand it into a **step-by-step action plan** so you don’t just “share your app” but do it in a way that positions you as a serious AI builder.

---

## 🔥 Expanded Day 30: “Launch & Share Your First AI App”

### **Step 1: Polish Your App (1–2 hours)**

* Make sure your app does **one thing really well** (example: blog summarizer, idea generator, AI quiz app).
* Add a **simple landing screen** with app name + one-liner description.
* Test it on desktop and mobile — fix any obvious bugs.
* If possible, set up a free domain (Glide/Bubble let you publish easily).

---

### **Step 2: Create a Demo (1–2 hours)**

* Record a **30–60 sec Loom video**:

  1. Introduce yourself (“I built this AI app in 7 days with no code”).
  2. Show how the app works (live example).
  3. End with: “Would love your feedback — what should I add next?”
* Export Loom clip and keep a short GIF or screenshot too.

---

### **Step 3: Write Your Launch Post (1 hour)**

Format for LinkedIn/Twitter:

**Hook:** “🚀 I just built my first AI app in 7 days — without writing a single line of code.”
**Body:**

* What problem it solves
* What tools you used (Glide/Bubble + OpenAI)
* A quick demo clip or link
  **Call to action:** “Would love feedback. What feature should I add next?”

---

### **Step 4: Share in 3 Places (30 mins)**

* **LinkedIn/Twitter:** Main launch post.
* **Reddit or IndieHackers:** In “Show & Tell” section, people love new builds.
* **WhatsApp/Telegram to 3–5 friends:** Ask for real feedback.

---

### **Step 5: Collect Feedback (rest of day)**

* Write down every suggestion.
* Tag which are “quick fixes” vs “future upgrades.”
* Plan Day 31+ upgrades (chatbot integration, extra features).

---

### **Optional Level-Up**

* Add a **“Made with AI” badge** in your app footer.
* Create a **Notion page** that lists:

  * What the app does
  * How you built it
  * Roadmap for features

This builds trust and shows you’re serious about iteration.

---

👉 By the end of Day 30, you won’t just “share an app,” you’ll have:

* A public demo video
* A launch post on social media
* Early user feedback
* Your first entry in a growing AI portfolio

Do you want me to also script the **exact LinkedIn launch post** for Day 30 so you can copy-paste it when the time comes?
